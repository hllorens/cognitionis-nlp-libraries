The
flu
season
is
winding
down
,
and
it
has
killed
105
children
so
far
-
about
the
average
toll
.

The
season
started
about
a
month
earlier
than
usual
,
sparking
concerns
it
might
turn
into
the
worst
in
a
decade
.

It
ended
up
being
very
hard
on
the
elderly
,
but
was
moderately
severe
overall
,
according
to
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
.

Six
of
the
pediatric
deaths
were
reported
in
the
last
week
,
and
it
's
possible
there
will
be
more
,
said
the
CDC
's
Dr.
Michael
Jhung
said
Friday
.

Roughly
100
children
die
in
an
average
flu
season
.

One
exception
was
the
swine
flu
pandemic
of
2009-2010
,
when
348
children
died
.

The
CDC
recommends
that
all
children
ages
6
months
and
older
be
vaccinated
against
flu
each
season
,
though
only
about
half
get
a
flu
shot
or
nasal
spray
.

All
but
four
of
the
children
who
died
were
old
enough
to
be
vaccinated
,
but
90
percent
of
them
did
not
get
vaccinated
,
CDC
officials
said
.

This
year
's
vaccine
was
considered
effective
in
children
,
though
it
did
n't
work
very
well
in
older
people
.

And
the
dominant
flu
strain
early
in
the
season
was
one
that
tends
to
cause
more
severe
illness
.

The
government
only
does
a
national
flu
death
count
for
children
.

But
it
does
track
hospitalization
rates
for
people
65
and
older
,
and
those
statistics
have
been
grim
.

In
that
group
,
177
out
of
every
100,000
were
hospitalized
with
flu-related
illness
in
the
past
several
months
.

That
's
more
than
2
1/2
times
higher
than
any
other
recent
season
.

This
flu
season
started
in
early
December
,
a
month
earlier
than
usual
,
and
peaked
by
the
end
of
year
.

Since
then
,
flu
reports
have
been
dropping
off
throughout
the
country
.

"
We
appear
to
be
getting
close
to
the
end
of
flu
season,
"
Jhung
said
.

The
last
surviving
member
of
the
team
which
first
conquered
Everest
in
1953
has
died
in
a
Derbyshire
nursing
home
.

George
Lowe
,
89
,
died
in
Ripley
on
Wednesday
after
a
long-term
illness
,
with
his
wife
Mary
by
his
side
.

New
Zealand-born
Mr
Lowe
was
part
of
the
team
that
helped
Sir
Edmund
Hillary
and
Tenzing
Norgay
to
the
summit
in
1953
.

Family
friend
and
historian
Dr
Huw
Lewis-Jones
paid
tribute
to
a
"
gentle
soul
and
fine
climber
"
who
shunned
the
limelight
.

Mr
Lowe
also
took
part
in
the
trans-Antarctic
expedition
of
1957-58
,
which
made
the
first
successful
overland
crossing
of
Antarctica
via
the
South
Pole
.

He
later
made
expeditions
to
Greenland
,
Greece
and
Ethiopia
.

Speaking
to
the
BBC
in
1995
,
Mr
Lowe
said
of
his
Antarctic
adventure
:
"
We
estimated
we
could
do
it
in
100
days
,
and
we
got
across
on
the
99th
day
.

"
There
was
a
great
feeling
of
euphoria
from
everyone
.

It
had
a
multiplying
effect
.

"
We
were
pleased
that
England
and
New
Zealand
knew
about
it
,
and
we
thought
that
's
where
it
would
stop
.

"
He
also
talked
about
his
"
second
job
"
as
the
group
's
cameraman
,
and
having
to
wear
four
pairs
of
gloves
to
work
the
clockwork
camera
.

"
When
there
were
dramas
,
there
was
a
split
problem
.

Do
you
take
part
in
the
urgency
-
or
do
you
record
it
?

"
he
said
.

Dr
Lewis-Jones
,
the
former
curator
at
the
Scott
Polar
Research
Institute
at
the
University
of
Cambridge
,
who
first
met
Mr
Lowe
in
2005
,
called
him
a
"
hero
"
.

"
I
do
n't
often
use
that
word
but
then
it
is
not
very
often
that
you
get
to
meet
one,
"
he
said
.

A
book
of
memoirs
and
photographs
from
the
climb
by
Mr
Lowe
,
which
he
worked
on
with
Dr
Lewis-Jones
,
is
due
to
be
published
in
May
.

He
said
:
"
Lowe
was
a
brilliant
,
kind
fellow
who
never
sought
the
limelight
...
and
60
years
on
from
Everest
his
achievements
deserve
wider
recognition
.

"
He
was
involved
in
two
of
the
most
important
explorations
of
the
20th
Century
...
yet
remained
a
humble
,
happy
man
right
to
the
end
...
an
inspirational
lesson
to
us
all
.

"
Before
retiring
in
1984
,
Mr
Lowe
worked
as
an
Inspector
of
Schools
with
the
Department
of
Education
and
Sciences
,
and
he
leaves
three
sons
from
a
previous
marriage
.

The
last
British
climbing
member
of
the
1953
team
,
Mike
Westmacott
,
died
last
June
.

Israel
's
prime
minister
has
apologised
to
Turkey
for
"
any
errors
that
could
have
led
to
loss
of
life
"
during
the
2010
commando
raid
on
an
aid
flotilla
that
tried
to
breach
the
Gaza
blockade
.

Benjamin
Netanyahu
also
agreed
with
his
Turkish
counterpart
Recep
Tayyip
Erdogan
to
compensate
the
families
of
the
nine
activists
who
were
killed
.

Mr
Netanyahu
had
previously
only
expressed
regret
for
the
deaths
.

The
deal
was
brokered
by
US
President
Barack
Obama
during
a
visit
to
Israel
.

Mr
Erdogan
's
office
said
he
had
accepted
the
apology
,
"
in
the
name
of
the
Turkish
people
"
.

In
the
past
,
he
has
always
given
two
conditions
for
restoring
bilateral
relations
with
Israel
-
an
apology
and
compensation
for
victims
'
families
.

Nine
people
were
killed
on
board
the
Turkish
aid
ship
,
Mavi
Marmara
,
when
it
was
boarded
by
Israeli
commandos
while
trying
to
transport
aid
supplies
to
Gaza
in
May
2010
in
spite
of
an
Israeli
naval
blockade
.

The
Israeli
government
admitted
mistakes
were
made
in
intelligence-gathering
and
planning
,
but
insisted
its
commandos
used
lethal
force
because
activists
had
attacked
them
.

The
activists
said
the
troops
had
opened
fire
as
soon
as
they
boarded
the
vessel
,
which
was
in
international
waters
at
the
time
.

The
incident
provoked
an
international
outcry
and
led
to
a
major
deterioration
in
relations
between
Turkey
and
Israel
.

Before
departing
for
Jordan
on
Friday
afternoon
,
Mr
Obama
revealed
that
Mr
Netanyahu
and
Mr
Erdogan
had
just
spoken
by
telephone
.

Heavy
snow
is
causing
disruption
to
transport
across
the
UK
,
with
heavy
rainfall
bringing
flooding
to
the
south-west
of
England
.

Rescuers
searching
for
a
woman
trapped
in
a
landslide
at
her
home
in
Looe
,
Cornwall
,
said
they
had
found
a
body
.

Over
200,000
Belfast
customers
were
affected
by
a
blackout
but
power
is
starting
to
be
restored
.

Northern
Ireland
's
World
Cup
qualifier
with
Russia
has
been
postponed
until
15:00
GMT
Saturday
due
to
heavy
snow
.

There
are
12
flood
warnings
in
the
South
West
,
with
Met
Office
warnings
for
snow
covering
much
of
the
UK
.

This
comes
just
over
a
week
before
the
start
of
British
Summer
Time
.

BBC
forecasters
said
the
snow
would
cause
travel
disruption
across
northern
parts
of
the
UK
on
Friday
,
with
some
20cm-40cm
(
8in-16in
)
falling
in
places
.

Atrocious
conditions
could
be
expected
on
high
ground
,
they
said
.

Roads
in
northern
parts
of
Wales
,
the
Midlands
into
the
Pennines
,
southern
Scotland
and
Northern
Ireland
would
be
the
worst
affected
,
while
gale
force
winds
would
blow
snow
and
drifts
across
trans-Pennine
routes
,
they
added
.

Oil
giant
BP
has
said
it
will
buy
back
$8bn
of
shares
,
returning
to
shareholders
the
money
they
had
put
into
a
complicated
Russian
venture
.

It
said
it
"
expected
to
return
to
BP
shareholders
an
amount
equivalent
to
the
value
of
the
company
's
original
investment
in
TNK-BP
"
.

BP
agreed
to
sell
back
its
50%
stake
in
TNK-BP
to
Russia
's
Rosneft
in
October
in
return
for
$17.1bn
in
cash
and
shares
.

It
invested
in
TNK-BP
in
2003
.

BP
chairman
Carl-Henric
Svanberg
said
:
"
We
expect
our
stake
in
Rosneft
will
generate
long-term
value
for
BP
and
its
shareholders
.

But
this
buyback
programme
should
also
allow
our
shareholders
to
see
benefits
in
the
near-term
from
the
value
we
have
realised
by
reshaping
our
Russian
business
.

"
BP
expects
the
share
buyback
programme
could
take
between
12
and
18
months
to
complete
.

"
In
2003
BP
invested
around
$8bn
in
cash
,
shares
and
assets
in
the
formation
of
TNK-BP,
"
the
oil
giant
said
.

"
Over
the
following
decade
BP
received
a
total
of
$19bn
in
dividends
from
the
joint
venture
.

"
Although
BP
's
involvement
in
the
Russian
joint
venture
has
been
lucrative
,
relations
with
its
partners
have
often
been
fraught
with
disagreement
.

In
2011
,
the
AAR
consortium
attempted
to
block
a
drilling
joint
venture
in
the
Arctic
between
BP
and
Rosneft
through
the
courts
and
the
plan
was
eventually
dropped
.

As
well
as
internal
wrangles
,
BP
employees
at
TNK-BP
have
fallen
foul
of
Russian
authorities
.

While
serving
as
head
of
TNK-BP
,
Bob
Dudley
-
now
the
head
of
BP
as
a
whole
-
had
his
office
bugged
and
raided
by
the
police
and
met
with
onerous
back-tax
demands
,
legal
action
and
visa
problems
.

He
eventually
fled
the
country
in
2008
.

But
the
tie-up
with
Rosneft
will
keep
BP
in
Russia
,
allowing
it
to
continue
to
explore
and
exploit
the
country
's
vast
energy
resources
,
including
in
the
Arctic
region
.

And
Rosneft
benefits
from
BP
's
expertise
in
exploring
in
difficult
and
potentially
hazardous
conditions
.

Russian
police
and
tax
inspectors
have
raided
the
offices
of
the
human
rights
group
Memorial
and
other
civil
society
groups
which
get
foreign
funding
.

Memorial
is
famous
for
documenting
human
rights
abuses
in
Russia
.

The
US
embassy
in
Moscow
has
voiced
concern
and
asked
the
Russian
government
for
an
explanation
.

A
new
Russian
law
says
foreign-funded
non-governmental
groups
(
NGOs
)
linked
to
politics
must
register
as
"
foreign
agents
"
-
a
term
which
suggests
spying
.

In
the
worst
repressions
of
the
Soviet
period
the
label
"
foreign
agents
"
was
used
to
denounce
dissidents
-
or
simply
political
rivals
of
Joseph
Stalin
-
and
could
lead
to
execution
.

Memorial
says
inspectors
returned
to
its
Moscow
offices
on
Friday
,
having
already
seized
600
documents
including
accounts
on
Thursday
.

A
statement
on
the
Memorial
website
said
the
inspections
were
directly
linked
to
the
new
law
on
NGOs
and
the
targeted
groups
'
compliance
with
it
.

Memorial
director
Arseny
Roginsky
,
quoted
by
the
Russian
news
website
Vesti
,
said
it
was
"
a
complete
check
on
everything
concerned
with
our
sources
of
funding
"
.

He
insisted
that
the
NGO
law
"
will
not
change
our
position
at
all
"
.

"
We
wo
n't
refuse
foreign
donations
,
nor
will
we
register
as
a
'
foreign
agent',
"
he
said
.

Barack
Obama
would
make
a
great
stand-up
comic
,
not
because
he
's
the
funniest
president
ever
but
because
he
uses
jokes
the
same
way
many
of
us
comedians
do
:
as
a
weapon
.

Traditionally
,
the
(
intentionally
)
funny
lines
by
our
presidents
have
had
one
thing
in
common
:
They
were
self-deprecating
.

Sure
,
some
presidents
have
used
jokes
to
take
jabs
at
their
opponents
,
but
not
to
the
extent
of
Obama
.

During
his
tenure
,
he
has
increasingly
unleashed
biting
comedic
barbs
against
his
critics
and
political
adversaries
.

These
jokes
are
intended
to
do
more
than
simply
entertain
you
.

They
have
an
agenda
.

Obama
's
humor
is
often
delivered
the
way
a
comedian
dealing
with
a
heckler
would
do
it
.

He
tries
to
undermine
his
opponents
with
it
and
get
the
crowd
-
-
in
this
case
the
public
-
-
on
his
side
.

I
can
assure
you
that
having
a
crowd
laugh
at
your
critic/heckler
is
not
only
effective
in
dominating
them
,
it
's
also
very
satisfying
.

A
New
York
man
who
was
accused
of
faking
his
death
last
summer
pleaded
guilty
to
a
conspiracy
charge
Thursday
,
Nassau
County
District
Attorney
Kathleen
Rice
announced
.

Raymond
Roth
,
48
,
of
Massapequa
,
New
York
,
was
first
reported
missing
in
the
waters
off
Jones
Beach
late
last
July
by
his
22-year-old
son
,
Jonathan
Roth
.

Several
days
into
an
extensive
search
involving
multiple
agencies
,
New
York
State
Park
Police
said
,
authorities
learned
the
missing
man
was
in
South
Carolina
,
where
he
had
been
pulled
over
for
speeding
.

The
day
before
Raymond
Roth
was
pulled
over
,
his
wife
,
Evana
,
showed
authorities
e-mails
she
had
discovered
that
appeared
to
detail
a
plan
between
him
and
his
son
to
fake
his
death
.

Raymond
Roth
wanted
his
wife
and
son
to
collect
at
least
$410,000
in
life
insurance
benefits
while
he
started
a
new
life
in
Florida
,
Rice
said
.

State
police
arrested
both
men
in
early
August
on
charges
of
insurance
fraud
,
conspiracy
and
filing
a
false
report
.

Raymond
Roth
on
Thursday
agreed
to
plead
guilty
to
the
conspiracy
charge
in
exchange
for
a
sentence
of
90
days
in
jail
and
five
years
'
probation
,
the
district
attorney
's
office
said
.

He
also
must
pay
restitution
for
the
cost
of
the
search
-
-
$27,445
to
the
U.S.
Coast
Guard
and
$9,109
to
the
Nassau
County
Police
Department
.

Evana
Roth
told
CNN
in
August
she
thought
her
husband
devised
the
plan
after
he
was
fired
from
his
job
in
July
.

Her
attorney
,
Lenard
Leeds
,
said
she
had
been
unaware
of
the
ruse
before
she
uncovered
the
e-mail
correspondence
.

"
There
needs
to
be
a
way
for
me
to
find
out
how
things
are
going
.

Call
me
Sunday
night
at
8
PM
at
the
resort,
"
Raymond
Roth
wrote
in
an
e-mail
to
his
son
the
day
before
the
son
reported
him
missing
.

The
son
's
case
is
still
pending
,
the
district
attorney
said
.

Jonathan
Roth
's
attorney
,
Joey
Jackson
,
defended
his
client
after
his
arrest
,
saying
,
"
There
was
abuse
here
,
manipulation
here
,
coercion
here
"
from
the
father
.

Raymond
Roth
's
attorney
,
Brian
Davis
,
denied
in
August
that
Roth
had
involved
his
son
in
the
scheme
.

"
We
had
issues
concerning
the
facts
people
had
whether
(
Roth
)
had
an
agreement
with
his
son,
"
Davis
told
CNN
on
Thursday
.

"
He
's
admitted
it
now
.

He
's
accepted
responsibility
.

"
Davis
added
that
his
client
has
been
under
treatment
for
bipolar
disorder
in
recent
weeks
.

During
plea
negotiations
,
Raymond
Roth
asked
the
district
attorney
's
office
not
to
give
his
son
jail
time
,
Davis
said
.

On
the
advice
of
both
their
attorneys
,
father
and
son
have
not
been
in
contact
since
their
arrests
,
Davis
said
.

"
He
would
like
to
straighten
things
out
with
(
Jonathan
)
when
the
time
comes,
"
he
said
.

Before
the
arrival
of
Keep
,
which
Google
launched
this
week
,
there
was
no
default
note-taking
app
for
Android
.

It
was
a
glaring
hole
,
considering
that
Apple
's
iPhone
has
built-in
Notes
and
Reminders
apps
that
can
be
powered
by
Siri
.

Instead
of
settling
for
a
bare
bones
app
to
fill
the
void
,
the
search
giant
took
things
one
step
further
.

Keep
is
n't
simply
just
a
place
to
bank
whatever
random
half-thoughts
come
to
mind
:
Users
can
construct
to-do
lists
,
stash
photos
,
and
color
code
your
notes
-
-
all
in
one
well-designed
and
easy-to-use
interface
.

The
second
you
log
anything
into
your
phone
,
it
is
also
accessible
from
a
PC
Web
browser
via
Google
Drive
.

Alternatively
,
you
can
save
things
while
working
on
your
computer
,
and
it
will
instantly
appear
on
your
phone
,
ready
for
use
while
on
the
go
.

The
design
may
not
be
as
progressive
as
the
to-do
app
Clear
,
but
Keep
makes
up
for
that
in
its
simplicity
and
efficiency
.

Everything
in
Keep
is
presented
like
a
Microsoft
(
MSFT
,
Fortune
500
)
Windows
Phone-esque
stream
of
tiles
.

Swiping
left
or
right
will
archive
those
notes
you
no
longer
need
(
but
do
n't
want
to
erase
entirely
)
.

At
the
top
of
the
app
is
a
text
entry
field
that
serves
as
your
main
point
of
entry
for
all
new
notes
.

And
when
viewing
any
specific
note
,
tapping
any
part
of
that
note
(
title
,
body
,
etc.
)
will
allow
you
to
edit
it
.

The
entire
experience
is
frictionless
.

That
said
,
it
's
not
going
to
conquer
the
world
quite
yet
.

Organization
options
are
limited
-
-
color
coding
is
your
only
choice
,
and
you
ca
n't
re-order
your
notes
.

Sharing
with
others
is
mostly
limited
to
email
and
Google+
,
and
the
desktop
features
are
pretty
bare
bones
.

But
that
's
more
a
function
of
it
being
new
,
rather
than
poorly
thought
out
.

Like
most
things
Google
,
expect
the
company
to
flesh
out
Keep
over
time
and
really
turn
it
into
our
personal
internet
junk
drawer
.

It
's
easy
to
foresee
the
day
the
when
users
will
be
able
to
send
anything
from
their
Web
browser
or
Maps
directly
to
Keep
.

The
prospect
of
Keep
incorporating
features
of
services
such
as
Pinterest
or
Pocket
,
or
even
making
it
easy
to
catalog
streaming
media
,
could
turn
it
into
something
big
.

That
should
scare
Evernote
.

Keep
is
not
the
reinvention
of
the
wheel
in
any
aspect
-
-
there
are
a
plethora
of
third-party
apps
already
available
for
Android
.

But
it
is
a
well-exectuted
refinement
.

In
filling
a
minor
,
but
important
gap
in
its
mobile
ecosystem
,
Google
gives
the
competition
one
less
claim
of
superiority
over
Android
.

The
FAA
on
Friday
announced
it
will
close
149
regional
airport
control
towers
because
of
forced
spending
cuts
-
-
sparing
40
others
that
the
FAA
had
been
expected
to
shutter
.

A
four-week
,
phased
closure
of
the
149
control
towers
will
begin
on
April
7
,
the
FAA
said
.

The
FAA
had
been
expected
to
announce
the
closure
of
189
low
-
or
moderate-volume
towers
staffed
by
contractors
.

Before
Friday
's
announcement
,
it
said
it
would
consider
keeping
a
tower
open
if
the
airport
convinces
the
agency
it
is
in
the
"
national
interest
"
to
do
so
.

By
congressional
mandate
,
the
FAA
must
cut
nearly
$600
million
from
its
nearly
$48
billion
budget
this
fiscal
year
.

Because
the
majority
of
its
47,000
employees
are
air
traffic
controllers
,
it
is
impossible
to
cut
its
budget
without
affecting
controllers
,
the
agency
says
.

President
Barack
Obama
arrived
in
refugee-flooded
Jordan
on
Friday
after
scoring
a
diplomatic
coup
just
before
leaving
Israel
when
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu
apologized
to
Turkey
for
a
2010
commando
raid
that
killed
nine
activists
on
a
Turkish
vessel
in
a
Gaza-bound
flotilla
.

The
apology
,
long
sought
by
Turkish
Prime
Minister
Recep
Erdogan
,
eased
strained
feelings
between
Turkey
and
Israel
,
two
vital
U.S.
allies
in
the
Middle
East
.

It
happened
in
a
phone
call
to
Erdogan
during
a
final
meeting
between
Obama
and
Netanyahu
at
Ben
Gurion
International
Airport
in
Tel
Aviv
minutes
before
Air
Force
One
departed
for
Jordan
to
complete
the
president
's
Middle
East
swing
.

It
is
the
first
foreign
trip
of
his
second
term
.

A
statement
from
Netanyahu
's
office
said
the
apology
included
an
offer
of
compensation
.

However
,
there
was
confusion
later
when
the
Israeli
government
dropped
a
reference
in
its
original
statement
to
normalized
relations
between
the
countries
with
a
return
of
ambassadors
.

There
also
was
no
word
on
whether
the
once-close
nations
would
resume
the
joint
military
exercises
that
were
suspended
after
the
flotilla
raid
.

Turkey
had
been
prosecuting
four
Israeli
soldiers
in
absentia
and
Israel
initially
said
the
two
leaders
agreed
to
the
cancellation
of
legal
steps
against
the
troops
.

Later
,
however
,
its
amended
statement
omitted
that
action
as
well
.

China
's
state
leadership
transition
has
taken
place
this
month
against
an
ominous
backdrop
.

More
than
16,000
dead
pigs
have
been
found
floating
in
rivers
that
provide
drinking
water
to
Shanghai
.

A
haze
akin
to
volcanic
fumes
cloaked
the
capital
,
causing
convulsive
coughing
and
obscuring
the
portrait
of
Mao
Zedong
on
the
gate
to
the
Forbidden
City
.

So
severe
are
China
's
environmental
woes
,
especially
the
noxious
air
,
that
top
government
officials
have
been
forced
to
openly
acknowledge
them
.

Fu
Ying
,
the
spokeswoman
for
the
National
People
's
Congress
,
said
she
checked
for
smog
every
morning
after
opening
her
curtains
and
kept
at
home
face
masks
for
her
daughter
and
herself
.

Li
Keqiang
,
the
new
prime
minister
,
said
the
air
pollution
had
made
him
"
quite
upset
"
and
vowed
to
"
show
even
greater
resolve
and
make
more
vigorous
efforts
"
to
clean
it
up
.

Last
month
,
after
deadly
air
pollution
hit
record
levels
in
northern
China
,
officials
led
byWen
Jiabao
,
then
the
prime
minister
,
put
forward
strict
new
fuel
standards
that
the
oil
companies
had
blocked
for
years
.

But
there
are
doubts
about
whether
the
oil
companies
will
comply
,
especially
since
oil
officials
resisted
a
similar
government
order
for
higher-grade
fuel
four
years
ago
.

State-owned
power
companies
have
been
similarly
resistant
.

The
companies
regularly
ignore
government
orders
to
upgrade
coal-burning
electricity
plants
,
according
to
ministry
data
.

And
as
with
the
oil
companies
,
the
power
companies
exert
an
outsize
influence
over
environmental
policy
debates
.

In
2011
,
during
a
round
of
discussions
over
stricter
emissions
standards
,
the
China
Electricity
Council
,
which
represents
the
companies
,
pushed
back
hard
against
the
proposals
,
saying
that
the
costs
of
upgrading
the
plants
would
be
too
high
.

On
Feb.
28
,
Deutsche
Bank
released
an
analysts
'
note
saying
that
China
's
current
economic
policies
would
result
in
an
enormous
surge
in
coal
consumption
and
automobile
sales
over
the
next
decade
.

"
China
's
air
pollution
will
become
a
lot
worse
from
the
already
unbearable
level,
"
the
analysts
said
,
calling
for
drastic
policy
changes
and
"
a
strong
government
will
to
overcome
the
opposition
from
interest
groups
.

"
The
report
estimated
that
the
number
of
passenger
cars
in
China
was
on
track
to
hit
400
million
by
2030
,
up
from
90
million
now
.

A
Cyprus
exit
from
the
euro
union
,
if
it
comes
to
that
,
would
have
a
devastating
effect
on
the
country
's
citizens
,
who
are
among
the
most
indebted
in
the
euro
zone
.

And
for
European
unity
and
diplomacy
,
the
Cyprus
debacle
has
already
been
at
least
a
short-term
disaster
.

ut
for
the
broader
financial
system
in
Europe
,
the
losses
resulting
from
a
Cypriot
banking
collapse
and
the
country
's
return
to
its
former
currency
would
be
minimal
compared
with
the
havoc
that
Greece
would
have
created
had
it
not
been
bailed
out
.

And
that
,
economists
and
investors
contend
,
is
why
Germany
and
its
Dutch
stalking
horse
,
Jeroen
Dijsselbloem
,
the
president
of
the
Eurogroup
of
finance
ministers
,
were
so
adamant
that
depositors
-
large
and
small
,
Cypriot
and
Russian
-
contribute
5.8
billion
euros
(
$7.5
billion
)
toward
the
10
billion
euro
bailout
of
Cyprus
's
largest
banks
.

Greece
may
well
have
been
too
big
to
fail
last
year
,
but
Cyprus
,
which
creates
less
than
one-half
percent
of
the
euro
zone
's
gross
domestic
product
,
is
certainly
not
.

From
a
financial
standpoint
,
what
is
most
noteworthy
is
that
the
combined
debt
of
the
Cypriot
people
,
companies
and
government
is
2.6
times
the
size
of
the
country
's
gross
domestic
product
.

Only
Ireland
,
still
struggling
to
recover
from
the
banking
collapse
that
required
an
international
bailout
in
2010
,
has
a
higher
debt-to-G.D.P.
ratio
among
euro
zone
countries
.

As
debts
in
Europe
mount
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
ability
of
its
citizens
,
companies
and
governments
to
make
good
on
them
,
the
view
is
forming
in
Berlin
and
Brussels
that
a
signal
must
be
sent
that
citizens
and
investors
must
start
accepting
losses
for
the
euro
zone
to
survive
in
the
long
run
.

"
There
have
been
too
many
bailouts
in
Europe
;
it
's
time
to
remove
the
air
bags,
"
said
Stephen
Jen
,
a
former
economist
at
the
International
Monetary
Fund
who
runs
a
hedge
fund
in
London
.

"
This
is
not
a
Lehman,
"
he
said
,
referring
to
the
disastrous
chain
reaction
touched
off
by
the
collapse
of
Lehman
Brothers
in
2008
.

Eric
Dor
is
a
French
economist
who
has
studied
the
mechanics
of
how
a
country
might
remove
itself
from
the
monetary
union
.

By
his
calculations
,
the
euro
zone
-
through
its
central
banking
system
and
its
national
banks
-
has
just
27
billion
euros
in
outstanding
credit
exposure
to
Cyprus
.

That
is
a
mere
rounding
error
compared
with
the
euro
zone
G.D.P.
of
9.4
trillion
euros
.

Estimates
of
the
potential
cost
if
Greece
had
been
forced
into
a
disorderly
euro
exit
have
ranged
from
200
billion
euros
to
800
billion
euros
,
given
the
larger
exposure
that
the
European
Central
Bank
and
European
banks
had
to
the
country
.

"
This
explains
why
Germany
and
others
are
putting
so
much
pressure
on
Cyprus,
"
said
Mr.
Dor
,
head
of
research
at
the
Ieseg
School
of
Management
in
Lille
,
France
.

"
They
are
saying
we
can
take
the
risk
of
pushing
Cyprus
out
of
the
euro
zone
,
and
that
Europe
can
take
the
losses
without
going
broke
.

"
Mr.
Dor
notes
that
the
current
euro
zonewide
system
of
insuring
bank
deposits
up
to
100,000
euros
was
put
in
place
after
the
financial
panic
that
followed
the
Lehman
collapse
.

Those
deposits
are
supposed
to
be
insured
by
national
governments
.

So
when
the
president
of
Cyprus
admitted
this
week
that
his
country
did
not
have
the
money
to
backstop
the
30
billion
euros
of
guaranteed
bank
deposits
-
a
figure
greater
than
the
Cypriot
economy
itself
-
a
crucial
bond
of
trust
between
a
government
and
its
citizens
was
snapped
.

"
It
is
the
first
time
ever
that
the
leader
of
a
euro
zone
country
has
admitted
that
he
could
not
afford
to
pay
the
guarantee,
"
Mr.
Dor
said
.

A
hasty
expulsion
from
the
euro
zone
would
make
the
savings
of
the
Cypriot
people
all
the
more
evanescent
,
once
they
are
converted
back
into
Cypriot
pounds
,
the
currency
Cyprus
used
before
adopting
the
euro
in
2007
.

Former
President
Nicolas
Sarkozy
was
informed
Thursday
that
he
would
face
a
formal
investigation
into
whether
he
abused
the
frailty
of
Liliane
Bettencourt
,
90
,
the
heiress
to
the
L'
Oreal
fortune
and
France
's
richest
woman
,
to
get
funds
for
his
2007
presidential
campaign
.

Mr.
Sarkozy
has
denied
accepting
illegal
campaign
funds
from
Ms.
Bettencourt
,
either
personally
or
through
his
party
treasurer
at
the
time
,
Eric
Woerth
,
as
alleged
by
her
former
butler
.

Mr.
Sarkozy
's
lawyer
,
Thierry
Herzog
,
called
the
judge
's
decision
,
which
indicates
that
the
judge
believes
that
Mr.
Sarkozy
probably
committed
a
crime
,
"
incoherent
"
and
"
unjust
.

"
The
lawyer
said
he
would
appeal
.

The
ruling
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
Mr.
Sarkozy
,
who
lost
his
re-election
bid
last
May
and
with
it
his
presidential
immunity
from
prosecution
,
will
stand
trial
.

An
hour
before
her
colleagues
gathered
for
their
first
vote
of
a
new
Congress
,
Senator
Kelly
Ayotte
slipped
into
an
empty
Senate
chamber
to
savor
the
grandeur
of
her
legislative
home
.

As
Ms.
Ayotte
,
a
freshman
Republican
from
New
Hampshire
,
sat
down
at
the
wooden
desk
where
generations
of
lawmakers
from
her
state
had
cast
their
votes
,
a
doorman
marched
toward
her
with
purpose
.

The
desks
,
he
sternly
told
her
,
were
for
senators
only
.

Ms.
Ayotte
's
induction
that
January
day
in
2011
into
the
most
rarefied
ranks
of
the
nation
's
political
class
,
female
senators
,
had
begun
.

"
The
desk
thing
really
stuck
with
me,
"
Ms.
Ayotte
said
.

"
There
still
just
are
n't
that
many
of
us
.

"
In
the
90
years
since
Rebecca
Felton
of
Georgia
became
the
first
woman
in
the
United
States
Senate
-
sworn
in
for
a
mere
24
hours
-
women
remain
an
anomaly
in
the
upper
chamber
.

But
with
20
female
senators
now
in
office
,
an
all-time
high
,
women
have
morphed
from
the
curiosity
they
were
for
much
of
the
20th
century
into
an
important
new
force
on
key
committees
and
legislation
.

A
record
nine
women
now
lead
committees
,
including
some
of
the
most
powerful
ones
.

For
the
first
time
there
is
a
woman
-
Senator
Barbara
A.
Mikulski
,
a
Maryland
Democrat
-
in
charge
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Committee
,
which
dispenses
billions
of
dollars
annually
throughout
the
government
and
has
long
been
particularly
dominated
by
men
.

Senator
Patty
Murray
,
a
Washington
Democrat
,
is
the
first
chairwoman
of
the
Budget
Committee
and
is
charged
with
shaping
the
Democratic
strategy
in
the
fiscal
battle
dominating
Capitol
Hill
.

One
of
the
biggest
bills
to
pass
the
Senate
last
year
was
farm
legislation
led
by
Senator
Debbie
Stabenow
,
a
Michigan
Democrat
who
presides
over
the
agriculture
committee
.

Senator
Barbara
Boxer
,
the
California
Democrat
who
is
chairwoman
of
the
Environment
and
Public
Works
Committee
,
shepherded
the
highway
bill
.

"
We
are
growing
in
number,
"
said
Senator
Amy
Klobuchar
,
Democrat
of
Minnesota
.

"
But
more
importantly
,
we
are
growing
in
our
power
.

When
I
first
started
just
six
years
ago
,
it
was
unusual
to
have
a
woman
managing
a
bill
.

"
Just
as
important
,
even
male
senators
say
,
is
the
potential
the
women
hold
for
changing
the
tenor
of
the
Senate
and
pushing
for
compromise
in
the
highly
partisan
atmosphere
on
Capitol
Hill
.

"
I
do
n't
want
to
generalize
,
because
this
is
n't
true
of
all
of
them
,
but
they
tend
to
be
interested
in
finding
common
ground,
"
said
Senator
Rob
Portman
,
Republican
of
Ohio
.

"
So
I
think
it
's
going
to
have
,
and
is
having
,
a
positive
impact
on
the
Senate

"
While
partisan
division
is
the
central
characteristic
of
the
modern
Congress
,
women
have
begun
to
crack
away
at
the
gridlock
by
forming
coalitions
that
have
surprised
leaders
of
both
parties
.

Senator
Kirsten
E.
Gillibrand
,
Democrat
of
New
York
,
and
Senator
Susan
Collins
,
Republican
of
Maine
,
led
the
repeal
in
the
Senate
of
"
do
n't
ask
,
do
n't
tell
"
in
2010
,
allowing
gay
men
and
women
to
serve
openly
in
the
military
.

This
year
,
all
four
of
the
female
Senate
Republicans
split
with
their
party
and
voted
with
Senate
Democrats
to
reauthorize
the
Violence
Against
Women
Act
,
which
had
lapsed
during
the
last
Congress
.

Our
digital
age
is
all
about
bits
,
those
precise
ones
and
zeros
that
are
the
stuff
of
modern
computer
code
.

But
a
powerful
new
type
of
computer
that
is
about
to
be
commercially
deployed
by
a
major
American
military
contractor
is
taking
computing
into
the
strange
,
subatomic
realm
of
quantum
mechanics
.

In
that
infinitesimal
neighborhood
,
common
sense
logic
no
longer
seems
to
apply
.

A
one
can
be
a
one
,
or
it
can
be
a
one
and
a
zero
and
everything
in
between
all
at
the
same
time
.

It
sounds
preposterous
,
particularly
to
those
familiar
with
the
yes/no
world
of
conventional
computing
.

But
academic
researchers
and
scientists
at
companies
like
Microsoft
,
I.B.M.
and
Hewlett-Packard
have
been
working
to
develop
quantum
computers
.

Now
,
Lockheed
Martin
which
bought
an
early
version
of
such
a
computer
from
the
Canadian
company
D-Wave
Systems
two
years
ago
is
confident
enough
in
the
technology
to
upgrade
it
to
commercial
scale
,
becoming
the
first
company
to
use
quantum
computing
as
part
of
its
business
.

Skeptics
say
that
D-Wave
has
yet
to
prove
to
outside
scientists
that
it
has
solved
the
myriad
challenges
involved
in
quantum
computation
.

But
if
it
performs
as
Lockheed
and
D-Wave
expect
,
the
design
could
be
used
to
supercharge
even
the
most
powerful
systems
,
solving
some
science
and
business
problems
millions
of
times
faster
than
can
be
done
today
.

Ray
Johnson
,
Lockheeds
chief
technical
officer
,
said
his
company
would
use
the
quantum
computer
to
create
and
test
complex
radar
,
space
and
aircraft
systems
.

It
could
be
possible
,
for
example
,
to
tell
instantly
how
the
millions
of
lines
of
software
running
a
network
of
satellites
would
react
to
a
solar
burst
or
a
pulse
from
a
nuclear
explosion
something
that
can
now
take
weeks
,
if
ever
,
to
determine
.

Microsoft
Corp.
broke
sales
records
in
2010
when
it
released
its
Kinect
-
a
movement-tracking
device
that
enabled
Xbox
users
to
play
their
favorite
games
through
gestures
alone
,
without
need
of
a
controller
.

Now
,
with
the
help
of
outside
developers
,
the
software
giant
is
hoping
to
move
the
Kinect
beyond
gaming
.

Microsoft
is
expanding
into
China
with
a
company-funded
incubator
program
for
outside
developers
to
build
products
based
on
Kinect
technology
for
a
range
of
industries
including
health
care
and
retail
.

In
the
U.S.
,
11
companies
were
selected
last
year
for
the
accelerator
's
first
three-month
class
in
Seattle
,
out
of
nearly
500
applicants
.

Microsoft
said
it
has
identified
three
companies
for
the
China
program
to
run
through
June
.

The
company
gives
each
participating
startup
in
the
Seattle
program
$20,000
to
create
software
that
can
be
used
with
Kinect
for
Windows
,
but
it
is
is
n't
asking
for
any
ownership
stakes
or
intellectual
property
rights
.

Microsoft
also
does
n't
have
any
veto
power
over
the
ideas
.

What
Microsoft
gets
are
developers
around
the
world
working
on
ideas
that
could
potentially
open
up
Kinect
for
Windows
'
technology
to
new
markets
-
and
convince
consumers
and
businesses
to
buy
the
company
's
hardware
and
make
use
of
the
potential
apps
.

The
Windows-ready
Kinect
sensor
,
which
would
be
necessary
for
any
business
that
wants
to
use
these
potential
new
technologies
,
is
currently
selling
for
$250
through
Microsoft
,
more
than
twice
what
Microsoft
charges
for
the
gaming-only
Xbox
version
.

In
competitions
against
the
clock
,
some
athletes
display
an
ability
to
seize
control
.

Think
of
the
Clark-Kent-to-Superman
routines
that
John
Elway
and
Michael
Jordan
often
pulled
in
the
final
seconds
.

But
Iram
Leon
stands
on
the
sidelines
of
his
own
race
against
time
.

Lodged
in
his
brain
is
an
untreatable
and
inoperable
cancerous
tumor
that
statistics
suggest
will
kill
him
before
he
is
40
,
eight
years
from
now
.

Medical
science
is
advancing
at
a
rate
that
does
n't
preclude
the
development
of
a
treatment
,
but
it
's
not
clear
if
it
will
come
in
time
.

"
No
one
knows
what
technology
will
be
available
in
five
years,
"
said
Allan
Friedman
,
Duke
University
Hospital
neurosurgeon
in
chief
,
who
in
2011
removed
as
much
of
Leon
's
brain
tumor
as
possible
.

The
torment
of
enduring
that
wait
can
paste
a
cancer
patient
to
the
couch
,
a
surrender
heavily
associated
with
deadlier
outcomes
.

Some
seek
escape
in
their
careers
,
but
that
is
no
longer
an
option
for
Leon
,
who
early
this
year
was
forced
to
step
down
as
a
juvenile
probation
officer
in
Travis
County
,
Texas
,
a
position
he
had
held
for
almost
seven
years
.

His
thinking
is
no
longer
clear
,
said
Leon
,
adding
,
"
I
was
making
too
many
mistakes
on
the
stand
.

"
But
Leon
can
still
run
.

Two
years
after
his
brain-cancer
diagnosis
,
he
recently
ran
a
sub-five-minute
mile
for
the
first
time
since
high
school
.

What
has
startled
the
medical
community
even
more
is
what
Leon
did
this
month
in
Beaumont
,
Texas
.

He
won
the
Gusher
Marathon
,
finishing
in
3:07:35
.

That
was
one
second
slower
than
his
personal
record
in
the
26.2-mile
event
,
set
days
before
he
underwent
brain
surgery
in
early
2011
.

Israeli
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu
apologized
on
Friday
to
Turkish
Prime
Minister
Recep
Tayyip
Erdogan
for
a
raid
on
a
Turkish
flotilla
ship
,
a
move
that
will
help
restore
strained
ties
between
the
countries
.

The
call
,
which
happened
as
President
Barack
Obama
wrapped
up
his
first
presidential
visit
to
Israel
,
was
an
unexpected
outcome
from
a
Mideast
trip
that
seemed
to
yield
few
concrete
steps
.

Mr.
Netanyahu
's
office
confirmed
that
the
Israeli
leader
,
in
a
conversation
with
Mr.
Erdogan
,
"
agreed
to
restore
normalization
between
Israel
and
Turkey
,
including
the
dispatch
of
ambassadors
and
the
cancellation
of
legal
steps
against
[
Israeli
Defense
Forces
]
soldiers
.

"
Mr.
Erdogan
accepted
the
Israeli
apology
,
the
prime
minister
's
office
said
.

Mr.
Erdogan
has
long
sought
an
apology
for
the
raid
in
May
2010
on
the
Mavi
Marmara
,
which
was
part
of
a
flotilla
that
sought
to
break
Israel
's
blockade
of
Gaza
.

An
Israeli
raid
on
the
ship
left
nine
passengers
dead
,
all
of
them
Turkish
or
of
Turkish
descent
.

"
In
light
of
the
Israeli
investigation
into
the
incident
,
which
pointed
out
several
operational
errors
,
Prime
Minister
Netanyahu
apologized
to
the
Turkish
people
for
any
errors
that
could
have
led
to
loss
of
life
and
agreed
to
complete
the
agreement
on
compensation,
"
the
statement
said
.

Mr.
Netanyahu
told
Mr.
Erdogan
that
what
happened
on
board
the
Mavi
Marmara
was
"
unintentional
and
Israel
expresses
regret
over
injuries
and
loss
of
life,
"
according
to
the
statement
.

Mr.
Obama
said
later
at
a
news
conference
in
Amman
that
he
had
spoken
to
both
leaders
over
the
past
two
years
about
how
it
was
in
the
interests
of
both
countries
to
restore
normal
relations
.

He
said
he
discussed
the
issue
with
Mr.
Netanyahu
during
his
visit
to
Israel
this
week
,
and
that
they
agreed
the
timing
was
good
for
a
discussion
with
the
Turkish
leader
.

The
incident
was
a
subject
of
talks
between
Mr.
Netanyahu
and
President
Barack
Obama
during
the
president
's
trip
to
Israel
this
week
,
officials
said
.

Health
insurers
are
privately
warning
brokers
that
premiums
for
many
individuals
and
small
businesses
could
increase
sharply
next
year
because
of
the
health-care
overhaul
law
,
with
the
nation
's
biggest
firm
projecting
that
rates
could
more
than
double
for
some
consumers
buying
their
own
plans
.

The
projections
,
made
in
sessions
with
brokers
and
agents
,
provide
some
of
the
most
concrete
evidence
yet
of
how
much
insurance
companies
might
increase
prices
when
major
provisions
of
the
law
kick
in
next
year
-
a
subject
of
rigorous
debate
.

The
projected
increases
are
at
odds
with
what
the
Obama
Administration
says
consumers
should
be
expecting
overall
in
terms
of
cost
.

The
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
says
that
the
law
will
"
make
health-care
coverage
more
affordable
and
accessible,
"
pointing
to
a
2009
analysis
by
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
that
says
average
individual
premiums
,
on
an
apples-to-apples
basis
,
would
be
lower
.

The
gulf
between
the
pricing
talk
from
some
insurers
and
the
government
projections
suggests
how
complicated
the
law
's
effects
will
be
.

Carriers
will
be
filing
proposed
prices
with
regulators
over
the
next
few
months
.

Part
of
the
murkiness
stems
from
the
role
of
government
subsidies
.

Federal
subsidies
under
the
health
law
will
help
lower-income
consumers
defray
costs
,
but
they
are
generally
not
included
in
insurers
'
premium
projections
.

Many
consumers
will
be
getting
more
generous
plans
because
of
new
requirements
in
the
law
.

The
effects
of
the
law
will
vary
widely
,
and
insurers
and
other
analysts
agree
that
some
consumers
and
small
businesses
will
likely
see
premiums
go
down
.

Starting
next
year
,
the
law
will
block
insurers
from
refusing
to
sell
coverage
or
setting
premiums
based
on
people
's
health
histories
,
and
will
reduce
their
ability
to
set
rates
based
on
age
.

That
can
raise
coverage
prices
for
younger
,
healthier
consumers
,
while
reining
them
in
for
older
,
sicker
ones
.

The
rules
can
also
affect
small
businesses
,
which
sometimes
pay
premiums
tied
to
employees
'
health
status
and
claims
history
.
