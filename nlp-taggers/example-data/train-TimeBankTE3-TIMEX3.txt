So O
when O
Wong O

spent O
seventy O
million O

for O
this O

, O
he O
thought O
it O
was O
a O

He O
sold O
the O

five O

he O

In O
Hong O

Now B-TIMEX3
with O

, O
three O
of O

And O
Wong O

will O
be O
lucky O
to O
break O
even O

All O

the O

, O

only O
half O
that O
now B-TIMEX3
. O

They O
believe O
ah O
it O
will O
be O
always O
up O
going O
up O
and O
up O
ah O
forever O
. O

Nobody O
believe O
this O
any O
more O
. O

Of O
all O
of O
Asia O
's O
economies O
, O
Hong O
Kong O
is O
the O
most O
robust O
. O

But O
in O
the B-TIMEX3
past I-TIMEX3
three I-TIMEX3
months I-TIMEX3
, O
stocks O
have O
plunged O
, O
interest O
rates O
have O
soared O
and O
the O
downturn O
all O
across O
Asia O
means O
that O
people O
are O
not O
spending O
here O
. O

Hotels O
are O
only O
thirty O
percent O
full O
. O

You O
can O
get O

Still O
, O
there O
are O

And O
at O
the O

, O
after O
ten B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
of O

, O
they O
're O
talking O
about O

I O
think O
that O
the O
mood O
is O
fairly O
gloomy O
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
change O
for O
a B-TIMEX3
couple I-TIMEX3
of I-TIMEX3

. O

So O
for O
Hong O

, O
it O

time O
, O
as O

, O
to O

To O
either O

a O

Ah O
, O
we O

an O

up O

about O
sixteen O

something O

It O

It O
just O

Washington O
For O
his O
part O
, O
Fidel O
Castro O
is O
the O
ultimate O
political O
survivor O
. O

People O
have O
predicted O
his O
demise O
so O
many O
times O
, O
and O
the O
US O
has O
tried O
to O
hasten O
it O
on O
several O
occasions O
. O

Time O
and O
again O
, O
he O
endures O
. O

He O
has O
outlasted O
and O
sometimes O
outsmarted O
eight O
American O
presidents O
. O

Fidel O
Castro O
invited O
John O
Paul O
to O
come O
for O
a O
reason O
. O

This O
is O
clearly O
an O
opportunity O
for O
Cuba O
to O
look O
good O
internationally O
. O

The O
entire O
world O
will O
see O
images O
of O
the O
Pope O
in O
Cuba O
. O

They O
'll O
see O
images O
of O
the O
Pope O
with O
Fidel O
Castro O
. O

It O
will O
give O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
the O
view O
that O
Cuba O
is O
like O
any O
other O
nation O
, O
something O
the O
US O
has O
, O
of O
course O
, O
tried O
to O
persuade O
the O
world O
that O
it O
is O
not O
. O

For O
nearly B-TIMEX3
forty I-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
, O
the O
United O
States O
has O
said O
categorically O
it O
would O
not O
tolerate O
totalitarian O
rule O
in O
its O
own O
backyard O
. O

It O
is O
the O
US O
economic O
and O
political O
embargo O
which O
has O
kept O
Cuba O
in O
a O
box O
. O

The O
main O
positive O
for O
Castro O
to O
invite O
the O
Pope O
is O
international O
, O
to O
be O
able O
to O
say O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
, O
this O
government O
is O
not O
as O
closed O
, O
as O
intolerant O
, O
uh O
as O
totalitarian O
as O
some O
make O
it O
out O
to O
be O
. O

One O
of O
the O
scenarios O
widely O
advanced O
before O
the O
visit O
is O
that O
through O
the O
Pope O
, O
Cuba O
, O
still O
led O
by O
Castro O
, O
can O
begin O
a O
more O
productive O
relationship O
with O
the O
world O
. O

That O
will O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
bring O
pressure O
on O
Washington O
to O
change O
. O

Those O
observers O
looking O
for O
a O
battle O
between O
uncompromising O
representatives O
and O
very O
different O
ideologies O
will O
, O
in O
all O
likelihood O
, O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Castro O
has O
said O
that O
you O
can O
be O
a O
Communist O
and O
still O
be O
a O
Christian O
. O

He O
says O
he O
and O
the O
Pope O
both O
want O
to O
end O
the O
exploitation O
of O
man O
by O
man O
. O

The O
question O
is O
who O
will O
Cubans O
believe O
? O

The O
main O
negative O
is O
the O
risk O
that O
the O
Pope O
's O
visit O
will O
persuade O
a O
great O
many O
more O
Cubans O
to O
break O
loose O
of O
the O
Cuban O
government O
. O

If O
so O
, O
then O
the O
Pope O
's O
visit O
would O
really O
open O
up O
a O
new O
chapter O
in O
the O
government O
's O
relations O
with O
its O
own O
society O
. O

For O
the O
Cuban O
government O
, O
that O
is O
the O
risk O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
broadcast O
this B-TIMEX3
evening I-TIMEX3
, O
one O
more O
trip O
around O
Havana O
to O
see O
what O
it O
's O
been O
like O
since O
the O
last O
time O
. O

And O
in O
just O
a O
moment O
Diane O

have O
some O
other O
news O
. O

Finally O
today B-TIMEX3
, O
we O
learned O
that O
the O
space O
agency O
has O
finally O
taken O
a O
giant O
leap O
forward O
. O

Air O
Force O
Lieutenant O
Colonel O
Eileen O
Collins O
will O
be O
named O
commander O
of O
the O
Space O
Shuttle O
Columbia O
for O
a O
mission O
in O
December B-TIMEX3
. O

Colonel O
Collins O
has O
been O
the O
co-pilot O
before O
, O
but O
this O
time O
she O
's O
the O
boss O
. O

Here O

ABC O

Ned O

Even O
two O
hundred O
miles O
up O
in O

, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
glass O
ceiling O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
until O
twenty B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
after O
the O
first O
astronauts O
were O
chosen O
that O
NASA O
finally O
included O
six O
women O
, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
scientists O
, O
not O
pilots O
. O

No O
woman O
has O
actually O
been O
in O
charge O
of O
a O
mission O
until O
now B-TIMEX3
. O

Just O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
're O
doing O
the O
job O
that O
we O
're O
doing O
makes O
us O
role O
models O
. O

That O
was O
Eileen O
Collins O
, O
after O
she O
flew O
as O
the O
first O
ever O
co-pilot O
. O

Being O
commander O
is O
different O
. O

It O
means O
supervising O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
crew O
in O
training O
and O
leading O
them O
in O
flight O
. O

It O
is O
, O
in O
short O
, O
the O
kind O
of O
management O
job O
many O
American O
women O
say O
they O
've O
had O
to O
fight O
for O
. O

In O
space O
, O
some O
say O
female O
pilots O
were O
held O
up O
until O
now B-TIMEX3
by O
the O
lack O
of O
piloting O
opportunities O
for O
them O
in O
the O
military O
. O

Once O
Colonel O
Collins O
was O
picked O
as O
a O
NASA O
astronaut O
, O
she O
followed O
a O
normal O
progression O
within O
NASA O
. O

Nobody O
hurried O
her O
up O
. O

No O
one O
held O
her O
back O
. O

Many O
NASA O
watchers O
say O
female O
astronauts O
have O
become O
part O
of O
the O
agency O
's O
routine O
. O

But O
they O
still O
have O
catching O
up O
to O
do O
two O

and O
thirty O
four O
Americans O
have O
flown O
in O

It O
accused O

about O
a O

Scott O

on O
a O
10-hour B-TIMEX3

of O
three O

Previously B-TIMEX3
the O
Iraqis O
have O
resisted O
attempts O
to O
inspect O
such O
quarters O
. O

The O
U.N. O
Security O
Council O
has O
charged O
the O

with O
verifying O
that O
Iraq O
has O
destroyed O
its O
long-range O
missiles O

of O

It O
was O
the O

arrived O
Thursday B-TIMEX3

Then O
the O
Baghdad O

making O
it O
impossible O

Iraq O
alleged O

a O
disproportionately O

The O

Ritter O

that O

from O

in O
less B-TIMEX3
than I-TIMEX3
one I-TIMEX3

could O
do O

I O

whatever O
happens O
today B-TIMEX3

that O
our O

will O
continue O

One O

arrived O

would O
use O

to O
force O
Saddam O

to O

down O

The O

soften O

This O

Now B-TIMEX3
officials O
are O

whether O
, O
Rudolph O

who O
remains O
at O

is O
linked O
to O
all O

The O

authorities O
have O
discovered O
tantalizing O

Steel O
plates O
recovered O
at O

appear O
to O
match O
those O
found O
at O
the O

Those O

A O

tells O

there O
is O
a O

it O
would O
be O
extraordinary O
to O
have O
all O
these O

there O
not O

Good O
evening O
from O
the O
central O

in O
downtown O
Havana O
. O

We O
are O
here O
this B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
to O
witness O
the O
rendezvous O
that O
Fidel O
Castro O
and O
the O
Pope O
are O
having O
with O
history O
. O

We O
are O
here O
because O
what O
happens O
on O
this O
island O
will O
also O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
the O
United O
States O
. O

Everything O
that O
happens O
in O
Cuba O
gets O
America O
's O
attention O
. O

Incidentally O
, O
we O
just O
show O
up O
to O
do O
the O
broadcast O
, O
and O
Cubans O
want O
to O
know O
what O
we O
're O
going O
to O
tell O
Americans O
, O
in O
many O
cases O
, O
what O
their O
relatives O
in O
the O
United O
States O
are O
going O
to O
hear O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
is O
the O
eve O
of O
the O
Pope O
's O
visit O
to O
one O
of O
the O
last O
bastions O
of O
Communism O
anywhere O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
it O
is O
already O
causing O
enormous O
expectations O
. O

In O
Revolution O
Square O
, O
they O
put O
up O
a O
giant O
cross O
today B-TIMEX3
. O

And O
right O
across O
from O
the O
Cuban O
revolutionary O
icon O
Che O
Guevara O
, O
they O
now B-TIMEX3
have O
a O
giant O
portrait O
of O
Jesus O
. O

Above O
it O
in O
Spanish O
, O
Jesus O
, O
in O
you O
we O
believe O
. O

Not O
all O
Cubans O
believe O
, O
but O
Castro O
has O
invited O
everyone O
to O
welcome O
the O
man O
who O
has O
been O
one O
of O
Communism O
's O
most O
effective O
adversaries O
, O
and O
that O
's O
why O
there O
is O
suspense O
. O

Everyone O
appears O
to O
believe O
that O
somehow O
Cuba O
is O
going O
to O
change O
. O

Castro O
has O
said O
officially O
that O
it O
's O
okay O
to O
be O
enthusiastic O
. O

And O
so O
, O
people O
are O
increasingly O
enthusiastic O
by O
today B-TIMEX3
, O
Cuban O
television O
, O
which O
clings O
to O
the O
Communist O
Party O
line O
, O
actually O
began O
to O
promote O
its O
papal O
coverage O
. O

Today B-TIMEX3
, O
hundreds O
of O
people O
from O
the O
US O
began O
to O
arrive O
, O
including O
some O
Cuban O
Americans O
who O
left O
here O
when O
Castro O
came O
to O
power O
and O
are O
returning O
to O
Havana O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

The O
Pope O
's O
visit O
is O
important O
, O
but O
they O
are O
also O
coming O
home O
. O

This O
is O
quite O
an O
extraordinary O
story O
unfolding O
here O
. O

We O
'll O
come O
back O
to O
Havana O
later O
in O
the O
broadcast O
. O

But O
now B-TIMEX3
we O
're O
going O
to O
go O
back O
to O

, O
where O

has O
the O

The O

said O
today B-TIMEX3
it O
will O
re-examine O

CBS O

last B-TIMEX3
night I-TIMEX3
that O
the O
tomb O
may O
contain O
the O
remains O
of O
Air O
Force O
pilot O
Michael O
Blassie O
. O

There O
was O
a O
suspicion O
the O

was O
Blassie O
because O
his O
uniform O
and O
ID O

were O
found O
near O
the O
body O
in O
Vietnam O
. O

But O
subsequently O
, O
they O
were O
lost O
. O

Blassie O
's O
mother O
now B-TIMEX3
wants O
the O
remains O
in O
the O
tomb O
tested O
for O
DNA O
. O

The O
lights O
are O
out O
and O
the O
heat O
is O
off O
and O
those O
vital O
signs O
are O
not O
likely O
to O
change O
much O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
next I-TIMEX3
several I-TIMEX3
days I-TIMEX3
for O
p O

people O
in O

A O

WASHINGTON O
_ O
The O
economy O
created O
jobs O
at O
a O
surprisingly O
robust O
pace O
in O
January B-TIMEX3
, O
the O
government O
reported O
on O
Friday B-TIMEX3
, O
evidence O
that O
America O
's O
economic O
stamina O
has O
withstood O
any O
disruptions O
caused O
so O
far O
by O
the O
financial O
tumult O
in O
Asia O
. O

The O
Bureau O
of O
Labor O
Statistics O
said O
the O
economy O
added O
358,000 O
jobs O
last B-TIMEX3
month I-TIMEX3
, O
far O
above O
the O
235,000 O
forecast O
by O
economists O
. O

It O
was O
the O
third O
consecutive O
month O
that O
job O
generation O
has O
been O
exceptionally O
strong O
. O

With O
growing O
opportunities O
for O
work O
drawing O
more O
people O
into O
the O
labor O
force O
, O
the O
unemployment O
rate O
remained O
at O
4.7 O
percent O
last B-TIMEX3
month I-TIMEX3
, O
just O
a O
notch O
above O
its O
quarter-century O
low O
. O

The O
demand O
for O
workers O
also O
led O
employers O
to O
raise O
wages O
again O
last B-TIMEX3
month I-TIMEX3
. O

Average O
hourly B-TIMEX3
earnings O
of O
production O
and O
nonsupervisory O
employees O
rose O
4 O
cents O
, O
to O
$12.51 O
. O

The O
gain O
left O
wages O
3.8 O
percent O
higher O
than O
a B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
earlier I-TIMEX3
, O
extending O
a O
trend O
that O
has O
given O
back O
to O
workers O
some O
of O
the O
earning O
power O
they O
lost O
to O
inflation O
in O
the B-TIMEX3
last I-TIMEX3
decade I-TIMEX3
. O

But O
economists O
said O
the O
wage O
increase O
was O
not O
enough O
to O
raise O
any O
concerns O
about O
higher O
inflation O
. O

And O
because O
the O
Federal O
Reserve O
has O
made O
clear O
that O
it O
expects O
the O
economy O
to O
slow O
in O
coming B-TIMEX3
months I-TIMEX3
as O
ripple O
effects O
from O
Asia O
reach O
the O
United O
States O
, O
investors O
disregarded O
the O
large O
jobs O
gains O
, O
betting O
that O
neither O
a O
rise O
in O
interest O
rates O
nor O
resurgent O
inflation O
is O
looming O
. O

Stocks O
rose O
, O
pushing O
the O
Dow O
Jones O
industrial O
average O
up O
72.24 O
points O
, O
to O
8,189.49 O
, O
leaving O
the O

70 O

of O
its O

In O
the O
bond O
market O
, O
a O
sensitive O
barometer O
of O
inflation O

`` O
Job O

'' O
said O
Paul O
McCulley O
, O
an O
economist O
at O

. O

`` O
The O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
we O

got O
a O
lovely O
economy O

'' O
With O
potential O

counterbalanced O
by O
worries O
about O
possible O
price O
declines O
, O
the O
Fed O
and O
its O
chairman O
, O
Alan O
Greenspan O
, O
have O
suggested O
that O
they O
intend O
to O
keep O
interest O
rates O
unchanged O
until O
the O
economy O
tilts O
clearly O
in O
one O
direction O
or O
another O
. O

The O
job O
figures O
for O
January B-TIMEX3
extended O
a O
surge O
in O
employment O
gains O
that O
began O
last B-TIMEX3
fall I-TIMEX3
, O
just O
when O
the O
labor O
market O
had O
showed O
signs O
of O
cooling O
. O

After O
accounting O
for O
a O
small O
downward O
revision O
Friday B-TIMEX3
to O
December B-TIMEX3
's O
figures O
, O
the O
economy O
has O
been O
creating O
jobs O
at O
a O
rate O
of O
358,000 O
a O
month O
for O
the B-TIMEX3
last I-TIMEX3
four I-TIMEX3
months I-TIMEX3
_ O
and O
381,000 O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
last I-TIMEX3
three I-TIMEX3
months I-TIMEX3
_ O
after O
averaging O
242,000 O
for O
the B-TIMEX3
first I-TIMEX3
nine I-TIMEX3
months I-TIMEX3
of O
1997 B-TIMEX3
. O

The O
surge O
in O
jobs O
reflects O
a O
remarkable O
confluence O
of O
positive O
and O
self-reinforcing O
economic O
forces O
. O

Inflation O
has O
been O
almost O
nonexistent O
, O
and O
consumer O
confidence O
has O
been O
extremely O
strong O
. O

After O
a O
short O
, O
sharp O
drop O
when O
Asia O
's O
financial O
problems O
first O
became O
clear O
, O
the O
stock O
market O
has O
rebounded O
and O
corporate O
profits O
have O
remained O
healthy O
. O

Long-term O
interest O
rates O
, O
an O
important O
indicator O
of O
economic O
stability O
, O
have O
fallen O
in O
the B-TIMEX3
last I-TIMEX3
few I-TIMEX3
months I-TIMEX3
. O

Lower O
rates O
have O
helped O
invigorate O
housing O
and O
other O
interest-sensitive O
sectors O
of O
the O
economy O
by O
making O
loans O
more O
affordable O
, O
and O
have O
allowed O
companies O
to O
continue O
investing O
heavily O
in O
more O
efficient O
equipment O
. O

The O
likelihood O
that O
the O
federal O
budget O
will O
soon O
move O
from O
deficit O
into O
surplus O
has O
further O
improved O
the O
outlook O
. O

The O
less O
money O
the O
government O
needs O
to O
borrow O
, O
the O
more O
is O
freed O
for O
private O

President O
Clinton O
welcomed O
the O
job O
figures O
at O
a O
news O
conference O
Friday B-TIMEX3
. O

His O
advisers O
said O
the O
results O
reflected O
not O
just O
from O
balancing O
the O
budget O
, O
but O
also O
initiatives O
like O
improved O
access O
to O
education O
and O
training O
and O
the O
opening O
of O
foreign O
markets O
to O

. O

`` O
There O
are O
enormous O
economic O
and O
social O
benefits O
from O
our O

Janet O
Yellen O
, O
the O
chairwoman O
of O
the O
White O
House O

Council O
of O
Economic O
Advisers O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
biggest O
employment O
gains O
came O
in O
the O
construction O
industry O
, O
which O
added O
92,000 O
jobs O
in O
January B-TIMEX3
. O

The O
increase O
reflected O
the O
strength O
of O
the O
housing O
industry O
, O
which O
has O
been O
helped O
not O
just O
by O
declining O
interest O
rates O
but O
also O
by O
unusually O
warm O
weather O
. O

Service O
industries O
also O
showed O
solid O
job O
gains O
, O
as O
did O
manufacturers O
, O
two O
areas O
expected O
to O
be O
hardest O
hit O
when O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
Asian O
crisis O
hit O
the O
American O
economy O
. O

The O
major O
harm O
from O
Asia O
is O
likely O
to O
come O
from O
the O
plunge O
in O
the O
value O
of O
many O
Asian O
currencies O
relative O
to O
the O
dollar O
, O
a O
situation O
that O
is O
expected O
to O
lead O
to O
a O
surge O
of O
inexpensive O
imports O
into O
the O
United O
States O
, O
hurting O
American O
competitors O
. O

And O
the O
weakness O
of O
the O
Asian O
economies O
is O
also O
likely O
to O
lead O
to O
decreased O
demand O
for O
American O
exports O
. O

`` O
The O

been O
running O
on O
the O

`` O
Those O

NEWARK O
, O
N.J. O
_ O
A O
new O
Essex O
County O
task O
force O
began O
delving O
Thursday B-TIMEX3
into O
the O
slayings O
of O
14 O
black O
women O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
last I-TIMEX3
five I-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
in O
the O
Newark O
area O
, O
as O
law-enforcement O
officials O
acknowledged O
that O
they O
needed O
to O
work O
harder O
to O
solve O
the O
cases O
of O
murdered O
women O
. O

The O
police O
and O
prosecutors O
said O
they O
had O
identified O
different O
suspects O
in O
six O
of O
the O
cases O
and O
had O
yet O
to O
find O
any O
pattern O
linking O
the O
killings O
or O
the O
victims O
, O
several O
of O
whom O
were O
believed O
to O
be O
prostitutes O
. O

State O
, O
county O
and O
local O
law-enforcement O
officials O
have O
expressed O
concerns O
in O
recent B-TIMEX3
months I-TIMEX3
about O
a O
possible O
pattern O
of O
murdered O
women O
and O
a O
disproportionate O
number O
of O
unsolved O
cases O
. O

Citing O
an O
example O
, O
Sgt. O
Derek O
Glenn O
, O
a O
spokesman O
for O
the O
Newark O
Police O
Department O
, O
said O
that O
of O
nine O
women O
who O
had O
been O
killed O
last B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
, O
suspects O
had O
been O
arrested O
in O
only O
four O
cases O
. O

But O
over O
all O
, O
arrests O
were O
made O
in O
more O
than O
60 O
percent O
of O
murder O
cases O
, O
he O
said O
. O

Eight O
of O
the O
14 O
killings O
since O
1993 B-TIMEX3
were O
already O
under O
investigation O
by O
the O
Newark O
Police O
Department O
, O
Glenn O
said O
. O

Of O
the O
eight O
victims O
, O
three O
were O
stabbed O
, O
two O
were O
strangled O
, O
two O
were O
beaten O
to O
death O
and O
one O
was O
asphyxiated O
, O
he O
said O
, O
and O
these O
different O
methods O
of O
killing O
and O
other O
evidence O
seem O
to O
indicate O
that O
the O
eight O
cases O
are O
not O
related O
. O

But O
with O
the O
task-force O
investigation O
just O
getting O
under O
way O
, O
officials O
have O
been O
careful O
not O
to O
draw O
any O
firm O
conclusions O
, O
leaving O
open O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
serial O
killer O
in O
some O
of O
the O
cases O
. O

There O
have O
been O
no O
arrests O
in O
any O
of O
the O
slayings O
. O

`` O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
a O
pattern O
yet O
, O
'' O
said O
Patricia O
Hurt O
, O
the O
Essex O
County O
prosecutor O
, O
who O
created O
the O
task O
force O
on O
Tuesday B-TIMEX3
. O

`` O
The O
type O
of O
lifestyle O
these O
women O
have O
is O
extremely O
dangerous, O
'' O
she O
said O
. O

The O
New O
York O
Times O
said O
in O
an O
editorial O
on O
Saturday B-TIMEX3
, I-TIMEX3
April I-TIMEX3
25 I-TIMEX3
: O
The O
Supreme O
Court O
took O
a O
detour O
this B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
from O
the O
core O
principle O
of O
gender O
fairness O
it O
vindicated O
two B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
ago I-TIMEX3
in O
its O
ruling O
invalidating O
the O
use O
of O
sexual O
stereotypes O
to O
justify O
denying O
women O
admission O
to O
the O
Virginia O
Military O
Institute O
. O

By O
a O
6-3 O
vote O
, O
the O
court O
upheld O
a O
discriminatory O
immigration O
law O
that O
gives O
a O
child O
born O
overseas O
to O
an O
unmarried O
American O
woman O
a O
better O
chance O
at O
citizenship O
than O
a O
child O
born O
to O
an O
unmarried O
American O
man O
. O

Under O
the O
statute O
, O
a O
child O
born O
abroad O
to O
an O
unwed O
American O
mother O
is O
automatically O
considered O
a O
U.S. O
citizen O
. O

But O
the O
child O
of O
an O
unwed O
American O
father O
has O
no O
citizenship O
rights O
unless O
the O
father O
takes O
the O
affirmative O
step O
of O
acknowledging O
paternity O
and O
formally O
agrees O
to O
provide O
support O
until O
the O
child O
turns O
18 O
. O

The O
majority O
's O
views O
were O
expressed O
in O
three O
separate O
opinions O
, O
the O
most O
disquieting O
of O
which O
was O
written O
by O
a O
liberal O
member O
, O
Justice O
John O
Paul O
Stevens O
, O
and O
joined O
by O
a O
conservative O
, O
Chief O
Justice O
William O
Rehnquist O
. O

The O
opinion O
, O
which O
found O
the O
gender O
distinction O
reasonable O
, O
relied O
heavily O
on O
outmoded O
generalities O
about O
family O
roles O
, O
including O
the O
flawed O
presumption O
that O
mothers O
have O
a O
closer O
relationship O
to O
their O
children O
than O
fathers O
do O
. O

As O
Justice O
Stephen O
Breyer O
asked O
in O
a O
strong O
dissent O
, O
`` O
what O
sense O
does O
it O
make O
'' O
to O
apply O
citizenship O
barriers O
`` O
only O
to O
fathers O
and O
not O
to O
mothers O
in O
today O
's O
world O
_ O
where O
paternity O
can O
readily O
be O
proved O
and O
where O
women O
and O
men O
both O
are O
likely O
to O
earn O
a O
living O
in O
the O
workplace O
? O

'' O
. O

Justices O
Sandra O
Day O
O'Connor O
and O
Anthony O
Kennedy O
seemed O
to O
agree O
that O
the O
law O
amounted O
to O
unconstitutional O
sex O
discrimination O
. O

Butinstead O
of O
providing O
the O
votes O
to O
strike O
it O
down O
, O
they O
chose O
to O
uphold O
it O
on O
the O
flimsy O
ground O
that O
because O
the O
sex O
of O
the O
parent O
and O
not O
the O
child O
made O
the O
difference O
under O
the O
law O
, O
the O
plaintiff O
did O
not O
have O
standing O
to O
bring O
the O
case O
. O

The O
Justice O
Department O
, O
which O
supported O
the O
statute O
, O
did O
not O
cover O
itself O
with O
glory O
either O
. O

The O
department O
retreated O
from O
its O
position O
in O
the O
VMI O
case O
when O
it O
argued O
that O
the O
government O
could O
not O
make O
policy O
based O
on O
stereotypes O
`` O
even O
when O
those O
stereotypes O
reflect O
current B-TIMEX3
realities O
. O

'' O
As O
for O
the O
court O
, O
it O
managed O
with O
its O
splintered O
ruling O
to O
cast O
doubt O
both O
on O
the O
constitutionality O
of O
the O
immigration O
provisions O
it O
upheld O
and O
on O
its O
true O
commitment O
to O
fighting O
gender O
stereotypes O
. O

Former O
savings O
and O
loan O
chief O
, O
Charles O
Keating O
, O
is O
facing O
more O
legal O
troubles O
in O
California O
. O

A O
federal O
appeals O
court O
has O
reinstated O
his O
state O
convictions O
for O
securities O
fraud O
. O

NPR O

Elaine O

more O
from O
San O

. O

In O
nineteen B-TIMEX3
ninety-one I-TIMEX3
Charles O
Keating O
was O
convicted O
in O
state O
court O
of O
helping O
to O
defraud O
thousands O
of O
investors O
who O
bought O
high O
risk O
junk O
bonds O
sold O
by O
Keating O
's O
employees O
at O
Lincoln O
savings O
and O

. O

The O
bonds O
became O
worthless O
when O
the O
bankrupt O
thrift O
was O
seized O
by O
government O
regulators O
. O

Keating O
's O
convictions O
were O
thrown O
out O
in O
nineteen B-TIMEX3
ninety-six I-TIMEX3
on O
a O
technicality O
. O

And O
on O
that O
basis O
Keating O
was O
released O
from O
prison O
before O
he O
was O
eligible O
for O
parole O
. O

Now B-TIMEX3
the O
ninth O
US O
circuit O
court O
of O
appeals O
has O
ruled O
that O
the O
original O
appeal O
was O
flawed O
since O
it O
brought O
up O
issues O
that O
had O
not O
been O
raised O
before O
. O

That O
means O
the O
convictions O
stand O
, O
a O
ruling O
likely O
to O
send O
Keating O
's O
lawyers O
back O
to O
state O
court O
where O
they O
must O
start O
over O
with O
a O
new O
appeal O

Experts O

the O

so O

it O
can O
not O

any O

So O
that O

No O

The O
British O
government O
has O
formally O
called O
for O
Sinn O
Fein O
, O
the O
IRA O
's O
political O
wing O
, O
to O
be O
expelled O
from O
the O
multiparty O
peace O
talks O
on O
northern O
Ireland O
. O

The O
move O
had O
been O
widely O
expected O
after O
northern O
Ireland O
police O
said O
they O
believe O
the O
IRA O
was O
behind O
two O
killings O
in O
Belfast O
last B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
. O

Sinn O
Fein O
chairman O
Mitchell O
McLaughlin O
says O
the O
party O
will O
challenge O
the O
move O
by O
legal O
means O
if O
they O
have O
to O
. O

We O
're O
going O
to O
fight O
it O
. O

And O
uh O
we O
've O
already O
challenged O
, O
very O
strongly O
, O
the O
uh O
the O
terms O
in O
which O
this O
has O
been O
presented O
. O

But O
we O
're O
challenging O
it O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
uh O
the O
RUC O
uh O
have O
offered O
an O
opinion O
, O
and O
this O
opinion O
is O
going O
to O
be O
used O
as O
a O
mechanism O
for O
ejecting O
us O
from O
the O
talks O
, O
and O
uh O
that O
's O
a O
very O
serious O
. O

Any O
decision O
to O
expel O
Sinn O

must O
be O
agreed O
jointly O
by O

Tomorrow B-TIMEX3
the O

whether O
a O

now B-TIMEX3
located O

Mount O

can O
relocate O
to O
their O
county O
. O

In O
some O
respects O
, O
that O
's O
typical O
county O
business O
, O
but O
tomorrow B-TIMEX3
's O
vote O
has O
international O
implications O
. O

The O
board O
will O
decide O
whether O
the O
Islamic O
Saudi O
Academy O
, O
funded O
by O
the O
government O
of O
Saudi O
Arabia O
, O
can O
move O
to O
Ashburn O

But O
local O
residents O
have O
not O
exactly O
laid O
out O
the O
red O

for O
their O

The O
World O
's O
Nancy O
Marshalll O
has O
our O
story O
. O

Inside O
the O
Islamic O
Saudi O
academy O
in O
Mount O
Vernon O
, O
Virginia O
, O
many O
of O
the O
girls O
wear O
head O
scarves O
and O
some O
of O
the O
neatly O
dressed O
children O
are O
in O
uniforms O
. O

The O
instruction O
is O
in O
English O
for O
most O
classes O
, O
in O
Arabic O
for O
language O
and O
religious O
studies O
. O

The O
school O
says O
it O
teaches O
the O
children O
to O
be O
good O
Muslims O
and O
good O
students O
. O

They O
're O
learning O
a O
civics O
lesson O
from O
the O
residents O
of O
Loudon O
county O
. O

The O
Islamic O
Saudi O
Academy O
has O
twelve O
hundred O
mostly O
American O
students O
but O
would O
take O
thirty-five O
hundred O
if O
it O
had O
the O
room O
. O

The O
academy O
bought O
a O
hundred O
acres O
in O
Loudon O
county O
, O
Virginia O
, O
and O
asked O
for O
permission O
to O
build O
a O
fifty O
million O
dollar O
campus O
. O

In O
the O
nearby O
suburban O
housing O
tracts O
, O
someone O
dropped O
off O
leaflets O
warning O
the O
school O
could O
bring O
thousands O
of O
Middle O
Eastern O
strangers O
and O
terrorists O
. O

Some O
residents O
of O
the O
mostly O
white O
, O
mostly O
middle O
class O
area O
became O
alarmed O
. O

James O
Zogby O
of O
the O
Arab O
American O
Institute O
says O
it O
's O
a O
familiar O
story O
. O

There O
is O
, O
a O
- O
at O
a O
very O
deep O
level O
in O
our O
culture O
, O
um O
I O
think O
, O
a O
sense O
of O
, O
of O
ignorance O
about O
Islam O
, O
a O
fear O
about O
who O
Muslims O
are O
and O
what O
they O
're O
doing O
. O

Many O
local O
residents O
denounced O
the O
bigotry O
, O
but O
opposition O
to O
the O
school O
then O
shifted O
. O

Now B-TIMEX3
critics O
of O
the O
academy O
are O
targeting O
its O
owner O
, O
the O
Saudi O
government O
. O

Pastor O
James O
Allmen O
of O
the O
fellowship O
church O
and O
school O
in O
Ashburn O
has O
led O
the O
anti-Saudi O
campaign O
. O

James O
Allmen O
says O
he O
has O
no O
problem O
with O
a O
privately O
funded O
academy O
, O
but O
he O
has O
a O
big O
problem O
with O
a O
Saudi O
funded O
school O
. O

The O
Saudi O
Arabian O
government O
has O
an O
atrocious O
record O
on O
human O
rights O
and O
is O
known O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
offending O
countries O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
religious O
persecution O
. O

That O
's O
correct O
. O

And O
that O
is O
a O
condition O
of O
the O
application O
, O
then O
. O

At O
a O
public O
hearing O
on O
the O
Islamic O
Saudi O
Academy O
's O
application O
, O
the O
split O
in O
county O
opinion O
was O
obvious O
, O
supporters O
of O
the O
academy O
, O
including O
Ann O
Robinson O
, O
said O
the O
Saudis O
were O
just O
providing O
a O
service O
and O
it O
was O
unfair O
to O
penalize O
children O
. O

We O
do O
not O
further O
the O
purpose O
of O
human O
rights O
in O
the O
world O
by O
violating O
the O
human O
rights O
under O
our O
own O
constitution O
. O

But O
opponents O
said O
the O
school O
might O
be O
a O
target O
for O
terrorist O
attacks O
, O
complained O
about O
its O
tax O
exempt O
status O
, O
and O
wondered O
why O
the O
Saudis O
are O
not O
compelled O
to O
allow O
Christians O
to O
worship O
in O
their O
country O
. O

Virginia O
Welch O
delivered O
this O
message O
to O
the O
county O
board O
of O
supervisors O
. O

I O
urge O
you O
to O
do O
the O
right O
thing O
and O
send O
a O
message O
to O
the O
Saudis O
that O
the O
citizens O
of O
Loudon O
county O
embrace O
religious O
and O
human O
freedom O
. O

Loudon O
county O
officials O
say O
they O
'll O
rule O
on O
the O
application O
based O
only O
on O
land O
use O
issues O
and O
ignore O
all O
the O
other O
objections O
. O

What O
's O
really O
behind O
those O
objections O
, O
some O
say O
, O
is O
Loudon O
county O
's O
collision O
with O
a O
new O
reality O
in O
America O
that O
the O
country O
is O
changing O
religiously O
as O
surely O
as O
it O
is O
racially O
and O
ethnically O
. O

According O
to O
the O
Arab O
American O
institute O
, O
Islam O
will O
one B-TIMEX3
day I-TIMEX3
be O
the O
second O
largest O
religion O
in O
the O
country O
. O

For O
an O
indication O
of O
the O
problems O
that O
could O
face O
Muslims O
as O
they O
integrate O
into O

By O
mid B-TIMEX3

, O
official O

the O

that O

The O

about O

One O
of O
President O

has O
informed O
White O

Chief O
of O
Staff O
John O
Sununu O
that O
he O
has O
lost O
much O
of O
his O
support O
among O
Republicans O
, O
prompting O
an O
intense O
effort O
by O
Sununu O
to O
hold O
on O
to O
his O
job O
by O
demonstrating O
his O
GOP O
backing O
, O
White O
House O
and O
Republican O
sources O

Monday B-TIMEX3

Sununu O
was O
told O
Wednesday B-TIMEX3
by O
Bush O
's O
son O
, O
George O
, O
that O
he O
had O
alienated O
members O
of O
the O
Cabinet O
, O
the O
White O
House O
staff O
and O
the O
Republican O
political O
community O
, O
creating O
a O
situation O
that O
puts O
his O
effectiveness O
in O
significant O
doubt O
, O
the O
sources O
said O
. O

The O
message O
to O
the O
chief O
of O
staff O
was O
meant O
to O
be O
taken O
as O
a O
suggestion O
that O
Sununu O
offer O
to O
resign O
, O
one O
highly O
placed O
source O
said O
. O

Instead O
, O
Sununu O
sought O
to O
prove O
to O
the O
president O
that O
his O
supporters O
outnumber O
his O
critics O
and O
that O
he O
should O
remain O
in O
his O

One O
senior O

Monday B-TIMEX3

the O

on O
a O
call O
from O

that O
" O
the O
noose O
is O
tightening O
around O
my O
neck O
, O
and O
I O
need O
your O

" O
; O
Another O
highly O

the O

met O
with O
Sununu O
last B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
after O
holding O
a O
series O
of O

about O
the O

of O
the O

The O

said O
the O

Bush O
" O
sketched O
out O

" O
problems O
the O

" O
the O

Monday B-TIMEX3

That O
, O
the O
source O
said O
, O
was O
when O
Sununu O
started O
calling O
congressional O
Republicans O
and O
asking O
them O
to O
tell O
Bush O
that O
the O
conservative O
wing O

Mr. O

the O

in O

uh O

twenty O

quite O
a O
dramatic O

increasingly O
successful O
at O
recruiting O
younger O
members O
through O
the O
use O
of O
Internet O
web O
pages O
and O
the O
promotion O
of O
racist O
rock O
music O
. O

The O
Internet O
has O
certainly O
helped O
uh O
hate O
mongers O
to O
organize O
and O
uh O
to O
feel O
that O
they O
are O
part O
of O
a O
larger O
community O
, O
even O
if O
uh O
they O
are O
essentially O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
angry O
people O
sitting O
in O
their O
bedrooms O
uh O
all O
alone O
. O

Uh O
, O
in O
addition O
, O
white O
power O
racist O
music O
has O
become O
uh O
quite O
popular O
in O
certain O
sectors O
. O

Uh O
, O
there O
are O
over O
fifty O
thousand O
CDs O
a B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
sold O
with O
uh O
lyrics O
that O
are O
quite O
uh O
unbelievable O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
new O
members O
are O
joining O
chapters O
of O
the O
so O
called O
Christian O
Identity O
Movement O
which O
cites O
Biblical O
scripture O
as O
a O
foundation O
for O
a O
belief O
in O
white O
supremacy O
and O
anti-semitism O
. O

Mark O
Potach O
says O
such O
members O
are O
also O
intensely O
attracted O
to O
apocalyptical O
fantasies O
. O

The O
approach O
of O
the B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
two I-TIMEX3
thousand I-TIMEX3
has O
many O
of O
these O
groups O
in O
a O
kind O
of O
millennial O
frenzy O
. O

Uh O
, O
uh O
a O
- O
they O
believe O
, O
or O
at O
least O
many O
of O
them O
believe O
, O
uh O
that O
they O
are O
approaching O
the O
Battle O
of O
Armageddon O
in O
which O
they O
will O
be O
pitted O
against O
the O
uh O
kind O
of O
Satanic O
forces O
trying O
to O
take O
over O
the O
world O
. O

Mr. O
Potach O
notes O
older O
, O
more O
traditional O
groups O
like O
the O
Ku O
Klux O
Klan O
are O
also O
opening O
new O
chapters O
, O
thanks O
in O
part O
to O
their O
ability O
to O
use O
new O
technologies O
like O
the O

. O

The O
Federal O
Bureau O

it O
received O
more O

eight O

Law O

such O

are O
now B-TIMEX3

Afghanistan O
has O
been O
at O
war O
for O
twenty B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
, O
leaving O
a O
large O
part O
of O
the O
country O

male O
population O
dead O
or O
in O
exile O
. O

The O
United O
Nations O
says O
women O
and O
children O
make O
up O
about O
seventy-five O
percent O
of O
the O
Afghan O
population O
. O

An O
Afghan O
refugee O
in O
Switzerland O
, O
Homira O
Atimadi O
, O
is O
a O
senior O
official O
of O
a O
group O
called O
the O
International O
Working O
Group O
on O
Afghan O
Women O
. O

The O
group O
has O
branches O
in O
Pakistan O
, O
Iran O
, O
Europe O
, O
Australia O
, O
and O
North O
America O
. O

Ms. O
Atimadi O
says O
Afghan O
women O
have O
been O
victims O
of O
severe O
violations O
of O
human O
rights O
for O
the B-TIMEX3
past I-TIMEX3
twenty I-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
and O
she O
says O
she O
sees O
no O
end O
to O
the O
misery O
. O

She O
says O
security O
under O
the O
fundamentalist O
Taleban O
government O
is O
better O
, O
but O
everything O
else O
is O
worse O
. O

Women O
do O
not O
become O
victims O
of O
armed O
attack O
, O
but O
they O
do O
not O
have O
the O
right O
to O
work O
. O

And O
today B-TIMEX3
, O
the O
right O
to O
work O
is O
equal O
to O
r O
- O
the O
right O
to O
survival O
. O

Ms. O
Atimadi O
says O
the O
war O
has O
created O
a O
nation O
of O
widows O
. O

Women O
have O
become O
the O
sole O
support O
of O
their O
families O
. O

Yet O
, O
the O
Taliban O
have O
forbidden O
them O
to O
work O
. O

She O
says O
this O
puts O
the O
very O
existence O
of O
women O
's O
families O
at O
risk O
. O

She O
says O
the O
plight O
of O
women O
in O
urban O
areas O
is O
greater O
than O
that O
which O
exists O
in O
rural O
parts O
of O
the O
country O
. O

In O
cities O
, O
such O
as O
the O
capital O
Kabul O
, O
women O
are O
totally O
dependent O
on O
international O
aid O
for O
survival O
. O

Ms. O
Atimadi O
says O
the O
women O
of O
Kabul O
symbolize O
the O
suffering O
of O
all O
the O
women O
in O
Afghanistan O
. O

The O
aim O
is O
to O
bring O
in O
not O
only O
the O
focus O
on O
women O
's O
right O
to O
education O
, O
access O
to O

, O
but O
look O
beyond O
that O
and O
look O
at O
the O
roots O
of O
, O
uh O
of O
these O
problems O
. O

These O
are O
only O
the O
symptoms O
of O
the O
problems O
that O
are O
facing O
Afghanistan O
. O

For O
women O
in O
Afghanistan O
to O
be O
able O
to O
realize O
their O
rights O
, O
there O
have O
to O
be O
conditions O
of O
peace O

. O

Ms. O
Atimadi O

She O

The O
US O
government O
recently O
announced O
new O
regulations O
designed O
to O
change O
the O
way O
transplant O
organs O
are O
made O
available O
to O
sick O
patients O
. O

Under O
the O
new O
guidelines O
, O
donor O
organs O
will O
be O
made O
available O
to O
the O
sickest O
people O
first O
, O
wherever O
they O
live O
in O
the O
country O
. O

Currently O
, O
transplant O
organs O
are O
rationed O
through O
a O
regional O
system O
of O
distribution O
. O

The O
private O
group O
that O
runs O
the O
current O
system O
, O
United O
Network O
for O
Organ O
Sharing O
, O
or O
UNOS O
, O
objects O
to O
the O
new O
regulations O
. O

UNOS O
says O
the O
regulations O
put O
the O
federal O
government O
in O
charge O
of O
deciding O
who O
gets O
transplants O
and O
that O
many O
hospital O
transplant O
centers O
would O
be O
forced O
to O
close O
. O

Health O
and O
Human O
Services O
Secretary O
Do O
- O
Donna O
Shalala O
says O
patients O
who O
need O
an O
organ O
transplant O
should O
not O
have O
to O
take O
a O
chance O
that O
an O
organ O
will O
become O
available O
in O
their O
local O
area O
, O
nor O
should O
patients O
have O
to O
travel O
to O
transplant O
centers O
far O
from O
their O
homes O
to O
improve O
their O
chances O
of O
getting O
an O
organ O
. O

UNOS O
spokeswoman O
Donna O
Henry O
Wright O
says O
the O
new O
policy O
would O
not O
necessarily O
be O
more O
fair O
or O
effective O
because O
allowances O
are O
already O
made O
for O
the O
most O
needy O
patients O
. O

The O
sickest O
patients O
are O
already O
treated O
first O
. O

There O
are O
not O
huge O
waiting O
uh O
disparit O
- O
waiting O
time O
disparities O
amongst O
the O
very O
uh O
sickest O
patients O
. O

It O
's O
between O
two B-TIMEX3
to O
six B-TIMEX3
days I-TIMEX3
for O
every O
one O
uh O
of O
the O
sickest O
patients O
across O
the O
country O
. O

um O
So O
it O
's O
a O
- O
it O
's O
a O
fallacy O
that O
they O
're O
doing O
this O
because O
um O
the O
sickest O
patients O
are O
n't O
being O
served O
. O

Doctor O
James O
Burdick O
, O
the O
Professor O

Surgery O
at O
Johns O
Hopkins O
University O
Hospital O
in O
Baltimore O
, O
Maryland O
, O
and O
former O
President O
of O
UNOS O
, O
said O
the O
current O
system O
has O
evolved O
over O
several B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
and O
it O
works O
well O
. O

You O
may O
, O
in O
a B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
or I-TIMEX3
two I-TIMEX3
, O
save O
a O
few O
more O
lives O
if O
you O
do O
sickest O
first O
. O

But O
the O
number O
of O
patients O
waiting O
then O
begins O
to O
increase O
, O
um O
and O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
um O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
many O
more O
patients O
who O
are O
about O
to O
die O
of O
liver O
tra O
- O
uh O
without O
a O
liver O
transplant O
would O
accumulate O
. O

If O
you O
do O
the O
uh O
alternative O
extreme O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
save O
as O
many O
lives O
in O
the B-TIMEX3
early I-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
, O
by O
a O
small O
fraction O
. O

Our O
system O
is O
balanced O
, O
it O
's O
right O
in O
the O
middle O
. O

And O
, O
therefore O
, O
it O
works O
very O
well O
. O

Nationwide O
, O
there O
are O
about O
ten O
thousand O
patients O
waiting O
for O
liver O
transplants O
each B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
and O
only O
four O
thousand O
organs O
become O
available O
for O
transplants O
. O

Secretary O

UNOS O
five B-TIMEX3
months I-TIMEX3

, O
or O
gave O
them O
five B-TIMEX3
months I-TIMEX3
to O

turned O
down O
such O

laying O
off O
about O
300 O

25% O

A O
spokeswoman O
for O
Crum O

said O
employees O
were O
told O
early B-TIMEX3
this I-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
that O
numerous O
staff O
functions O
for O
the O
personal O
insurance O
lines O
were O
going O
to O
be O
centralized O
as O
a O
cost-cutting O
move O
. O

She O
said O
the O
move O
would O
result O
in O
a O
after-tax O
charge O
of O
less O
than O
$4 O
million O
to O
be O
spread O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
next I-TIMEX3
three I-TIMEX3
quarters I-TIMEX3

By O
comparison O
, O
for O
the B-TIMEX3
first I-TIMEX3

million O
, O
or O
$4.55 O
a O

billion O
. O

Earnings O
at O
Xerox O
's O
financial-services O
operations O
actually O
rose O
slightly O
, O
but O
that O
was O
largely O
because O
capital O
gains O
at O
Crum O
amp O
Forster O
offset O
Hurricane O
Hugo O
payments O
and O
the O
reserves O
set O
up O
to O
cover O
future O
payments O
. O

Property/casualty O
insurance O
has O
been O
a O
tough O
business O
in O
recent B-TIMEX3
quarters I-TIMEX3
, O

been O
cutthroat O
and O
natural O

the O
California O
earthquake O
have O
resulted O
in O
huge O
payments O

Upjohn O
Co. O
said O
it O
will O
offer O
an O
early O
retirement O
package O
to O
as O
many O
as O
1,100 O
employees O
in O
a O
cost-cutting O
move O
expected O
to O
result O
in O
a O
fourth-quarter B-TIMEX3
charge O
. O

Upjohn O
officials O
said O
they O
could O
n't O
estimate O
the O
size O
of O
the O
charge O
until O
they O
determine O
which O
employees O
, O
and O
how O
many O
, O
will O
participate O
in O
the O
retirement O
plan O
. O

But O
the O
pharmaceutical O
company O
said O
it O
" O
anticipates O
the O
long-term O
savings O
resulting O
from O
the O
plan O
's O
implementation O
will O
more O
than O
offset O
short-term O
costs O
. O

" O
The O
program O
, O
available O
to O
Upjohn O
employees O
55 O
years O
old O
or O
older O
, O
could O
increase O
an O
individual O
's O
retirement O
benefits O
10% O
to O
20% O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Upjohn O
is O
offering O
a O
one-time O
retirement O
bonus O
equal O
to O
six O
months O
of O
base O
pay O

Chairman O
Theodore O
Cooper O
called O
the O

part O
of O
the O

two-year B-TIMEX3
strategy O
to O
implement O
budget O
constraints O
and O
" O
an O
effective O
headcount-control O
program O
. O

" O
But O
some O
analysts O
questioned O
how O
much O
of O
an O
impact O
the O
retirement O
package O
will O
have O
, O
because O
few O
jobs O
will O
end O
up O
being O
eliminated O
. O

" O
It O
's O
a O
cosmetic O
move, O
" O
said O
Jonathan O
S. O
Gelles O
of O
Wertheim O
Schroder O
amp O
Co. O
According O
to O
Upjohn O
's O
estimates O
, O
only O
50% O
to O
60% O
of O
the O
1,100 O
eligible O
employees O
will O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
plan O
. O

Upjohn O
further O
estimated O
that O
about O
50% O
of O
the O
employees O
who O
leave O
for O
early O
retirement O
may O
be O
replaced O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
Upjohn O
will O
likely O
trim O
only O
about O
275 O

350 O
of O
its O
more O
than O
21,000 O

Upjohn O

said O
he O
had O
" O
heard O
nothing O
" O
to O

the O

reflects O
pressure O
on O

Courtaulds O
' O

Some O
analysts O
have O
said O
Courtaulds O
' O
moves O
could O
boost O
the O
company O
's O
value O
by O
5% O
to O
10% O
, O
because O
the O
two O
entities O

will O
carry O
a O
higher O
price O
earnings O
multiple O
than O
they O
did O
combined O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Courtaulds O
said O
the O
moves O
are O
logical O
because O
they O
will O
allow O
both O
the O
chemicals O
and O
textile O
businesses O
to O
focus O
more O
closely O
on O

Though O
Mr. O

since O

Courtaulds O

moving O
to O
keep O
its O
institutional O

Even O
without O

Unisys O
Corp. O
's O
announcement O
Friday B-TIMEX3
of O
a O
$648.2 O
million O
loss O
for O
the B-TIMEX3
third I-TIMEX3
quarter I-TIMEX3
showed O
that O
the O
company O
is O
moving O
even O
faster O
than O
expected O
to O
take O
write-offs O
on O
its O
various O
problems O
and O
prepare O
for O
a O
turnaround O
next B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
sheer O
size O
of O
the O
loss O
, O
coupled O
with O
a O
slowing O
of O
orders O
, O
made O
some O
securities O
analysts O
wonder O
just O
how O
strong O
that O
turnaround O
will O
be O
at O
the O
computer O
maker O
and O
defense-electronics O
concern O
. O

" O
Unisys O
is O
getting O
clobbered O
. O

Just O
clobbered, O
" O
said O
Ulric O
Weil O
, O
an O
analyst O
at O
Weil O
amp O
Associates O
who O
had O
once O
been O
high O
on O
the O
company O
. O

" O
The O
quarter O
was O
terrible O
, O
and O
the O
future O
looks O
anything O
but O
encouraging O
. O

" O
Unisys O
, O
whose O
revenue O
inched O
up O
3.7% O
in O
the B-TIMEX3
quarter I-TIMEX3
to O
$2.35 O
billion O
from O
$2.27 O
billion O
in O
the B-TIMEX3
year-earlier I-TIMEX3
quarter I-TIMEX3
, O
had O
an O
operating O
loss O
of O
about O
$30 O
million O
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
the O
Blue O
Bell O
, O
Pa. O
, O
concern O
took O
a O
$230 O
million O
charge O
related O
to O
the O
layoffs O
of O
8,000 O
employees O
. O

That O
is O
at O
the O
high O
end O
of O
the O
range O
of O
7,000 O
to O
8,000 O
employees O
that O
Unisys O
said O
a B-TIMEX3
month I-TIMEX3
ago I-TIMEX3
would O
be O
laid O
off O
. O

Unisys O
said O
that O
should O
help O
it O
save O
$500 O
million O
a O
year O
in O
costs O
, O
again O
at O
the O
high O
end O
of O
the O
previously O
reported O
range O
of O
$400 O
million O
to O
$500 O
million O
. O

The O
company O
also O
took O
a O
write-off O
of O
$150 O
million O
to O
cover O
losses O
on O
some O
fixed-price O
defense O
contracts O
, O
as O
some O
new O
managers O
took O
a O
hard O
look O
at O
the O
prospects O
for O
that O
slow-growing O
business O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Unisys O
set O
up O
an O
unspecified O
reserve O
- O
- O
apparently O
$60 O
million O
to O
$70 O
million O
- O
- O
to O
cover O
the O
minimum O
amount O
it O
will O
have O
to O
pay O
the O
government O
because O
of O
its O
involvement O
in O
the O
defense-procurement O
scandal O
. O

Unisys O
also O
noted O
that O
it O
paid O
$78.8 O
million O
in O
taxes O
during O
the B-TIMEX3
quarter I-TIMEX3
, O
even O
though O
tax O
payments O
normally O
would O
be O
minimal O
in O
a O
quarter O
that O
produced O
such O
a O
big O
loss O
. O

The O
tax O
payments O
will O
leave O
Unisys O
with O
$225 O
million O
in O
loss O
carry-forwards O
that O
will O
cut O
tax O
payments O
in O
future B-TIMEX3
quarters I-TIMEX3
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Unisys O
said O
it O
reduced O
computer O
inventories O
a O
further O
$100 O
million O
during O
the B-TIMEX3
quarter I-TIMEX3
, O
leaving O
it O
within O
$100 O
million O
of O
its O
goal O
of O
a O
reduction O
of O
$500 O
million O
by O
the B-TIMEX3
end I-TIMEX3
of I-TIMEX3
the I-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
. O

Still O
, O
Unisys O
said O
its O
European O
business O
was O
weak O
during O
the B-TIMEX3
quarter I-TIMEX3
, O
a O
worrisome O
sign O
given O
that O
the O
company O
has O
relied O
on O
solid O
results O
overseas O
to O
overcome O
weakness O
in O
the O
U.S. O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
past I-TIMEX3
several I-TIMEX3
quarters I-TIMEX3
. O

The O
company O
also O
reported O
slower O
growth O
in O
another O
important O
business O
: O
systems O
that O
use O
the O
Unix O
operating O
system O
. O

That O
would O
be O
a O
huge O
problem O
if O
it O
were O
to O
continue O
, O
because O
Unisys O
is O
betting O
its O
business O
on O
the O
assumption O
that O
customers O
want O
to O
move O
away O
from O
using O
operating O
systems O
that O
run O
on O
only O
one O
manufacturer O
's O
equipment O
and O
toward O
systems O
- O
- O
mainly O
Unix O
- O
- O
that O
work O
on O
almost O
anyone O
's O
machines O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Unisys O
must O
deal O
with O
its O
increasingly O
oppressive O
debt O
load O
. O

Debt O
has O
risen O
to O
around O
$4 O
billion O
, O
or O
about O
50% O
of O
total O
capitalization O
. O

That O
means O
Unisys O
must O
pay O
about O
$100 O
million O
in O
interest O
every B-TIMEX3
quarter I-TIMEX3
, O
on O
top O
of O
$27 O
million O
in O
dividends O
on O
preferred O
stock O
. O

Jim O
Unruh O
, O
Unisys O
's O
president O
, O
said O
he O
is O
approaching O
next O
year O
with O
caution O
. O

He O
said O
the O
strength O
of O
the O
world-wide O
economy O
is O
suspect O
, O
and O
does O
n't O
see O
much O
revenue O
growth O
in O
the O
cards O
. O

He O
also O
said O
that O
the O
price O
wars O
flaring O
up O
in O
parts O
of O
the O
computer O
industry O
will O
continue O
through O
next B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
. O

He O
said O
the O
move O
toward O
standard O
operating O
systems O
means O
customers O
are O
n't O
locked O
into O
buying O
from O
their O
traditional O
computer O
supplier O
and O
can O
force O
prices O
down O
. O

That O
, O
he O
said O
, O
is O
why O
Unisys O
is O
overhauling O
its O
whole O
business O
: O
It O
needs O
to O
prepare O
for O
a O
world O
in O
which O
profit O
margins O
will O
be O
lower O
than O
computer O
companies O
have O
been O
used O
to O
. O

" O
We O
've O
approached O
this O
not O
as O
a O
response O
to O
a O
temporary O
condition O
in O
the O
industry O
but O
as O
a O
fundamental O
change O
the O
industry O
is O
going O
through, O
" O
Mr. O
Unruh O
said O
. O

" O
The O
information-systems O
industry O
is O
still O
going O
to O
be O
a O
high-growth O
business O
, O
and O
we O
're O
confident O
that O
we O
have O
tremendous O
assets O
as O
a O
company O
. O

But O
we O
do O
n't O
minimize O
the O
challenges O
of O
the B-TIMEX3
near I-TIMEX3
term I-TIMEX3
. O

" O
Securities O
analysts O
were O
even O
more O
cautious O
, O
having O
been O
burned O
repeatedly O
on O
Unisys O
this B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
. O

Some O
had O
predicted O
earnings O
of O
more O
than O
$4 O
a O
share O
for O
this B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
, O
up O
from O
last B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
's O
fully O
diluted O
$3.27 O
a O
share O
on O
earnings O
of O
$680.6 O
million O
. O

But O
the O
company O
said O
Friday B-TIMEX3
that O
it O
had O
losses O
of O
$673.3 O
million O
through O
the B-TIMEX3
first I-TIMEX3
nine I-TIMEX3
months I-TIMEX3
, O
compared O
with O
earnings O
a B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
earlier O
of O
$382.2 O
million O
, O
or O
$2.22 O
a O
share O
fully O
diluted O
, O
as O
revenue O
inched O
up O
1.4% O
to O
$7.13 O
billion O
from O
$7.03 O
billion O
. O

And O
Unisys O
is O
expected O
to O
do O
little O
better O
than O
break O
even O
in O
the B-TIMEX3
fourth I-TIMEX3
quarter I-TIMEX3
. O

So O
Steve O
Milunovich O
at O
First O
Boston O
said O
he O
is O
cutting O
his O
earnings O
estimate O
for O
next B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
to O
$2 O
a O
share O
from O
$3 O
. O

" O
I O
was O
feeling O
like O
I O
was O
too O
high O
to O
begin O
with, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Mr. O
Weil O
of O
Weil O
amp O
Associates O
said O
he O
will O
remain O
at O
$1 O
a O
share O
for O
next B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
but O
said O
he O
wonders O
whether O
even O
that O
low O
target O
is O
at O
risk O
. O

" O
The O
break-even O
point O
for O
next B-TIMEX3

is O
much O
lower O
, O
but O
is O
it O
low O
enough O

Moreover O
, O
the O

Polly O
Peck O
International O
Inc. O
's O
agreement O
to O
acquire O
51% O
of O
Sansui O
Electric O
Co. O
proves O
that O
foreign O
companies O
can O
acquire O
Japanese O
companies O
- O
- O
if O
the O
alternative O
for O
the O
Japanese O
company O
is O
extinction O
. O

Polly O
Peck O
, O
a O
fast-growing O
British O
conglomerate O
, O
will O
pay O
15.6 O
billion O
yen O
( O
$110 O
million O
) O
for O
39 O
million O
new O
shares O
of O
Sansui O
, O
a O
well-known O
maker O
of O
high-fidelity O
audio O
equipment O
that O
failed O
to O
adjust O
to O
changing O
market O
conditions O
. O

Japanese O
government O
officials O
, O
eager O
to O
rebut O
foreign O
criticism O
of O
Japanese O
investments O
overseas O
, O
hailed O
the O
transaction O
as O
proof O
foreigners O
can O
make O
similar O
investments O
in O
Japan O
. O

Polly O
Peck O
's O
chairman O
, O
Asil O
Nadir O
, O
echoed O
the O
official O
Japanese O
view O
of O
the O
accord O
, O
which O
was O
announced O
Friday B-TIMEX3
. O

" O
The O
myths O
that O
Japan O
is O
not O
open O
to O
concerns O
from O
outside O
has O
, O
I O
think O
, O
been O
demolished O
at O
a O
stroke, O
" O
Mr. O
Nadir O
said O
. O

But O
analysts O
say O
Sansui O
is O
a O
special O
case O
. O

It O
expects O
to O
post O
a O
loss O
of O
6.4 O
billion O
yen O
for O
the B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
ending O
tomorrow B-TIMEX3
and O
its O
liabilities O
currently B-TIMEX3
exceed O
its O
assets O
by O
about O
13.8 O
billion O
yen O
. O

" O
If O
you O
find O
sound O
, O
healthy O
companies O
in O
Japan O
, O
they O
are O
not O
for O
sale, O
" O
said O
George O
Watanabe O
, O
a O
management-consultant O
at O
Tokyo-based O
Asia O
Advisory O
Services O
Inc. O
Statistics O
on O
acquisitions O
by O
foreigners O
vary O
in O
detail O
, O
because O
unlike O
Sansui O
, O
which O
is O
listed O
on O
the O
Tokyo O
and O
Osaka O
stock O
exchanges O
, O
most O
of O
the O
Japanese O
companies O
acquired O
by O
foreigners O
are O
privately O
held O
. O

But O
by O
all O
accounts O
foreign O
companies O
have O
bought O
only O
a O
relative O
handful O
of O
Japanese O
companies O
this B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
, O
while O
Japanese O
companies O
have O
acquired O
hundreds O
of O
foreign O
companies O
. O

Nor O
do O
analysts O
expect O
the O
Sansui O
deal O
to O
touch O
off O
a O
fresh O
wave O
of O
foreign O
purchases O
. O

If O
the O
strong O
yen O
and O
the O
high O
stock O
prices O
of O
Japanese O
companies O
were O
n't O
deterrents O
enough O
, O
webs O
of O
cross-shareholdings O
between O
friendly O
Japanese O
companies O
and O
fiercely O
independent O
Japanese O
corporate O
attitudes O
repel O
most O
would-be O
acquirers O
. O

Usually O
when O
a O
Japanese O
company O
is O
ready O
to O
sell O
, O
it O
has O
few O
alternatives O
remaining O
, O
and O
the O
grim O
demeanors O
of O
Sansui O
's O
directors O
at O
a O
joint O
news O
conference O
here O
left O
little O
doubt O
that O
this O
was O
not O
the O
company O
's O
finest O
hour O
. O

Sansui O
was O
once O
one O
of O
Japan O
's O
premier O
makers O
of O
expensive O
, O
high-quality O
stereo O
gear O
for O
audiophiles O
. O

But O
in O
recent B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
, O
the O
market O
has O
moved O
toward O
less O
expensive O
" O
mini-component O
" O
sets O
, O
miniaturized O
amplifiers O
and O
receivers O
and O
software O
players O
that O
could O
be O
stacked O
on O
top O
of O
each O
other O
. O

Some O
of O
Sansui O
's O
fellow O
audio-specialty O
companies O
, O
such O
as O
Aiwa O
Co. O
and O
Pioneer O
Electric O
Corp. O
, O
responded O
to O
the O
challenge O
by O
quickly O
bringing O
out O
mini-component O
products O
of O
their O
own O
, O
by O
moving O
heavily O
into O
the O
booming O
compact O
disk O
businesses O
or O
by O
diversifying O
into O
other O
consumer-electronics O
fields O
, O
including O
laser O
disks O
or O
portable O
cassette O
players O
. O

Sansui O
was O
late O
into O
the O
mini-component O
business O
and O
failed O
to O
branch O
into O
other O
new O
businesses O
. O

As O
the O
yen O
soared O
in O
recent B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
, O
Sansui O
's O
deepening O
financial O
problems O
became O
a O
vicious O
circle O
. O

While O
competitors O
moved O
production O
offshore O
in O
response O
to O
the O
sagging O
competitiveness O
of O
Japanese O
factories O
, O
Sansui O
lacked O
the O
money O
to O
build O
new O
plants O
in O
Southeast O
Asia O
. O

" O
Our O
company O
has O
not O
been O
able O
to O
cope O
very O
effectively O
with O
" O
changes O
in O
the O
marketplace O
, O
said O
Ryosuke O
Ito O
, O
Sansui O
's O
president O
. O

But O
even O
a O
Japanese O
company O
that O
looks O
like O
a O
dog O
may O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
a O
good O
investment O
for O

foreign O
concern O

Murasawa O
, O

consultant O
for O

, O
said O
his O

will O

recommending O

more O
often O

" O

negative O
, O

positive, O
" O
Mr. O
Murasawa O
said O
. O

" O
In O
some O

acquisitions O
make O
sense O

" O
Whether O
Polly O

acquisition O
makes O
sense O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
but O
at O
the O
news O
conference O
, O
Mr. O
Nadir O
brimmed O
with O
self-confidence O
that O
he O
can O
turn O
Sansui O
around O
. O

Sansui O
, O
he O
said O
, O
is O
a O
perfect O
fit O
for O

operations O
, O
which O
make O
televisions O
, O

original O
equipment O
maker O
" O
basis O
for O

He O
said O
Polly O
Peck O
will O
greatly O
expand O
Sansui O
's O
product O
line O
, O
using O
Sansui O
's O
engineers O
to O
design O
the O
new O

, O
and O
will O
move O

of O
most O
products O
other O
than O
sophisticated O

offshore O
into O
Polly O
Peck O

own O

. O

" O
Whatever O
capital O
it O
( O
Sansui O
) O
needs O
so O
it O
can O
compete O
and O
become O
a O
totally O
global O
entity O
capable O
of O
competing O
with O
the O
best O
in O
the O
world O
, O
that O
capital O
will O
be O
injected, O
" O
Mr. O
Nadir O
said O
. O

And O
while O
Polly O
Peck O
is O
n't O
jettisoning O
the O
existent O
top-management O
structure O
of O

, O
it O

bringing O
in O

The O
bolstered O
cellular O
agreement O
between O
BellSouth O
Corp. O
and O
LIN O
Broadcasting O
Corp. O
carries O
heightened O
risks O
and O
could O
fail O
to O
fend O
off O
McCaw O
Cellular O
Communications O
Inc. O
, O
the O
rival O
suitor O
for O
LIN O

Moreover O
, O
the O
amended O
pact O
shows O
how O
McCaw O

persistence O
has O
pushed O
LIN O
and O
BellSouth O
into O
a O
corner O
, O
forcing O
huge O
debt O
on O
the O
proposed O
new O
company O
. O

The O
debt O
, O
estimated O
at O
$4.7 O
billion O
, O
could O
mortgage O
the O

future O

power O
in O

to O
placate O
some O
LIN O

in O
the B-TIMEX3

The O

calls O
for O

its O
cellular O

properties O
with O
BellSouth O

to O
spin O
off O

But O
under O
new O
terms O
of O
the O
agreement O
, O
announced O
Friday B-TIMEX3
, O
LIN O
holders O
would O
receive O
a O
special O
cash O
dividend O
of O
$42 O
a O

representing O
a O
payout O
of O
about O
$2.23 O

shortly O
before O
the O

LIN O
said O
it O
expects O

to O
pay O
the O
dividend O
, O
but O
commitments O

still O
have O

Under O
previous O
terms O
, O

would O
have O

a O
dividend O
of O
only O
$20 O
a O

In O
addition O
, O
New O

LIN O
would O
exercise O
its O
right O
to O
buy O
out O
for O
$1.9 O

That O

also O
would O

In O

, O
McCaw O

flow O
would O
be O
sufficient O
to O
cover O

the O

The O

In O

But O
I O
do O

think O
we O

at O
that O

" O
Under O
its O

, O
Atlanta-based O
BellSouth O
would O
have O
a O
50% O

the O
pact O
further O
- O
- O

to O
ease O
concerns O

- O
BellSouth O

the O

Bell O
company O
ever O
decides O
to O

The O
provision O
, O
described O
as O
" O

" O
protection O
, O
would O
require O
BellSouth O
to O
pay O
a O
price O
equivalent O
to O
what O
an O
outside O

might O
have O

in O
June B-TIMEX3
1994 I-TIMEX3
for O
remaining O
shares O
at O
third-party O

To O
mollify O

concerned O
about O
the O
long-term O
value O
of O
the O
company O
under O
the O
BellSouth-LIN O
agreement O
, O
BellSouth O
also O
agreed O
to O
pay O
as O
much O
as O
$10 O
a O

or O
$540 O

, O
after O
five B-TIMEX3

, O
the O

from O

" O
We O

very O

BellSouth O

" O

this O
is O
a O
superior O

" O
But O
Kenneth O

a O
telecommunications O

with O

, O
finds O
the O
BellSouth O

flawed O

five O

" O
How O

? O

" O
he O
asked O

" O
There O

nothing O
preventing O
BellSouth O
from O
buying O
up O

in O
the O
meanwhile O
. O

" O
BellSouth O
's O
revised O
proposal O
surprised O
many O
industry O

, O
especially O
because O
of O
the O

William O
O. O

of O
the O
company O

BellSouth O

, O
said O
the O
revised O
agreement O

LIN O
would O
dilute O
BellSouth O
earnings O
by O
about O
9% O
in O
both O
1990 B-TIMEX3
and O
1991 B-TIMEX3
and O
by O
significantly O
less O
thereafter O
. O

Indeed O
, O
BellSouth O
's O
cellular O
operations O
were O
among O
the O
first O
in O
the O
country O
to O
become O
profitable O
. O

For O
1988 B-TIMEX3
, O
BellSouth O
earned O
$1.7 O
billion O
, O
or O
$3.51 O
a O
share O
, O
on O
revenue O
of O
$13.6 O
billion O
. O

Analysts O
were O
predicting O
1990 B-TIMEX3
BellSouth O
earnings O
in O
the O
range O
of O
$3.90 O
a O

, O
or O
$1.9 O
billion O
, O
but O
now B-TIMEX3
those O
estimates O
are O
being O
scaled O
back O

In O
composite O
trading O
Friday B-TIMEX3
on O
the O
New O

, O
BellSouth O

fell O
87.5 O

In O
national O
over-the-counter O

LIN O

Mr. O
Leon O
of O
Bear O

speculated O
that O
McCaw O
, O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O

might O
consider O
filing O
an O
antitrust O
suit O
against O

Peter O
DaPuzzo O
, O
head O
of O

trading O
at O
Shearson O
Lehman O
Hutton O
, O
acknowledges O
that O
he O
was O
n't O
troubled O
by O
program O
trading O
when O
it O
began O
in O
the O
pre-crash O
bull O
market O
because O
it O
added O
liquidity O
and O
people O
were O
pleased O
to O
see O
stock O
prices O
rising O
. O

" O
We O
were O
n't O
as O
concerned O
until O
they O
became O
sell O
programs, O
" O
says O
Mr. O
DaPuzzo O
, O
who O
now B-TIMEX3
thinks O
it O
adds O
unnecessary O
volatility O
. O

Shearson O
Lehman O
, O
however O

executes O

Shearson O
, O
Merrill O

say O
they O
do O
so O
only O
for O

however O
. O

Kidder O

Of O
course O
, O
there O
were O
sell O
programs O
in O
past B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
, O
too O
, O
but O
they O
seem O
to O
hurt O
market O
makers O
more O
painfully O
these B-TIMEX3
days I-TIMEX3
. O

That O
's O
largely O
because O
of O
defensive O
measures O
they O
adopted O
after O
the O
1987 B-TIMEX3
crash O
, O
when O
individual O
investors O
fled O
the O
market O
and O
trading O
activity O
dwindled O
. O

Market O
makers O
, O
to O
cut O
costs O
, O
slashed O
inventories O
of O
stocks O
they O
keep O
on O
hand O
to O
sell O
investors O
when O
other O
holders O
are O
n't O
selling O
. O

And O
to O
protect O
their O
reduced O
capital O
investment O
from O
eroding O
further O
, O
market O
makers O
became O
quicker O
to O
lower O
price O
quotes O
when O
sell O
programs O
are O
in O
progress O
. O

On O
days O
when O
prices O
are O
tumbling O
, O
they O
must O
be O
willing O
to O
buy O
shares O
from O
sellers O
when O
no O
one O
else O
will O
. O

In O
such O
an O
environment O
, O
market O
makers O
can O
suffer O
huge O
losses O
both O
on O
trades O
made O
that O
day O
at O
steadily O
dropping O
prices O
and O
in O
the O
value O
of O
their O
inventories O
of O

. O

" O
It O
makes O
no O

for O
us O
to O
put O

at O

when O
you O
know O
you O

going O
to O

" O

Mr. O

But O
this O
skittishness O
, O
Mr. O
Antolini O
says O
, O
is O
creating O
liquidity O
problems O
in O
certain O
OTC O
stocks O
. O

" O
It O
's O
harder O
to O
sell O
stocks O
when O
the O
sell O

in O

some O

do O
n't O

agrees O
that O

is O
hurting O
the O
market O

efforts O
to O
bring O
back O

. O

But O
, O
he O
observes O
, O
while O

suffer O
losses O
when O

drags O
the O

down O

The O
problem O

is O
that O

The O

said O
that O
selling O

enormous O

that O
the O

dropped O
Friday B-TIMEX3
more O
on O
a O
lack O
of O
any O
substantial O

interest O
. O

They O
said O
contributing O
to O
the O
downward O
drift O
was O
the O
fact O
that O

chosen O
to O
square O

" O
It O

" O

is O

justified O
by O
the O

. O

" O
Traders O
said O
the O

remains O
extremely O
nervous O

of O
the O
wild O

seen O

the O
New O

That O
's O
leaving O
small O

with O

feet O
, O
they O
said O
, O

prompting O

to O
take O
a O

on O

Concern O
about O

in O

, O

, O
caused O

has O
been O
losing O
share O
in O
the O
$6 O
billion O
ready-to-eat O
cereal O
market O
. O

Kellogg O
's O
current B-TIMEX3
share O
is O
believed O
to O
be O
slightly O
under O
40% O
while O
General O
Mills O
' O
share O
is O
about O
27% O
. O

Led O
by O
its O
oat-based O
Cheerios O
line O
, O
General O
Mills O
has O
gained O
an O
estimated O
2% O
share O
so O
far O
this B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
, O
mostly O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
Kellogg O
. O

Each O
share O
point O
is O
worth O
about O
$60 O
million O
in O
sales O
. O

Analysts O
say O
much O
of O
Kellogg O
's O
erosion O
has O
been O
in O
such O
core O
brands O
as O
Corn O
Flakes O
, O
Rice O
Krispies O
and O
Frosted O
Flakes O
, O
which O
represent O
nearly O
one-third O
of O
its O
sales O
volume O
. O

Kellogg O
is O
so O
anxious O
to O
turn O
around O
Corn O
Flakes O
sales O
that O
it O
soon B-TIMEX3
will O
begin O
selling O
boxes O
for O
as O
little O
as O

" O
Mr. O

he O
would O

be O
surprised O
if O
, O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
next I-TIMEX3
two I-TIMEX3

or I-TIMEX3
so I-TIMEX3
, O
General O

increased O

more O
. O

In O
announcing O
the O
plant O
delay O
, O
Kellogg O
Chairman O
William O
E. O
LaMothe O
said O
, O
" O
Cereal O
volume O
growth O
in O
the O
U.S. O
has O
not O
met O
our O
expectations O
for O
1989 B-TIMEX3
" O
. O

He O
said O
construction O
would O
n't O
resume O
until O
market O
conditions O
warrant O
it O
. O

Kellogg O
indicated O
that O
it O
has O
room O
to O
grow O
without O
adding O
facilities O
. O

The O
company O
has O
five O
other O
U.S. O
plants O
, O
including O
a O
modern O
facility O
at O
its O
Battle O
Creek O
headquarters O
known O
as O
Building O
100 O
, O
which O
is O
to O
add O
bran-processing O
and O
rice-processing O
capacity O
next B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
. O

General O
Mills O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
finds O
itself O
constrained O
from O
boosting O
sales O
further O
because O
its O
plants O
are O
operating O
at O
capacity O
. O

A O
large O
plant O
in O
Covington O
, O
Ga. O
, O
is O
to O
come O
on O

next B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
. O

A O
Kellogg O
officer O
, O
who O
asked O
not O
to O
be O
named O
, O
said O
the O
Memphis O
project O
was O
" O
pulled O
in O
for O
a O
reconsideration O
of O
costs, O
" O
an O
indication O
that O
the O
ambitious O
plans O
might O
be O
scaled O
back O
in O
any O
future O
construction O
. O

Initial O
cost O
estimates O
for O
the O
plant O
, O
which O
was O
to O
have O
been O
built O
in O
phases O
, O
ranged O
from O
$1 O
billion O
to O
$1.2 O
billion O
. O

A O
company O
spokesman O
said O
it O
was O
" O
possible O
, O
but O
highly O
unlikely, O
" O
that O
the O
plant O
might O
never O
be O
built O
. O

" O
As O
we O
regain O
our O
leadership O
level O
where O
we O
have O
been O
, O
and O
as O
we O
continue O
to O
put O
new O
products O
into O
the O

need O
additional O
capacity O
, O
we O
will O
look O
at O

our O

plan, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

The O
new O

most O
advanced O

The O

had O
retained O

But O
in O
recent B-TIMEX3

reported O
that O

Subcontractors O
said O
they O

Fluor O
Daniel O
already O
has O
reassigned O
most O

, O
the O

said O
. O

Last B-TIMEX3
Friday I-TIMEX3
's O
announcement O
was O
the O
first O
official O
word O
that O
the O

was O
in O

that O
the O

plans O
for O

in O

may O
have O
been O
overly O
optimistic O
. O

Until O

" O
Mr. O

, O
Kellogg O

that O
it O

" O

" O
said O
David O

vice O
president O
for O

, O
at O
a O
news O
conference O
yesterday B-TIMEX3

" O
There O
's O
some O

at O

we O
'd O
stop O
bidding O
. O

" O
He O
would O
n't O
specify O
what O
it O
was O
. O

And O
powerful O
political O
pressures O
may O
convince O
the O
Conservative O
government O
to O
keep O
its O
so-called O
golden O
share O
, O
which O
limits O
any O
individual O
holding O
to O
15% O
, O
until O
the O
restriction O
expires O
on O
Dec. B-TIMEX3
31 I-TIMEX3
, I-TIMEX3
1990 I-TIMEX3
. O

" O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
see O
the O
government O
doing O
something O
that O
Jaguar O
does O
n't O
want O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
next I-TIMEX3
14 I-TIMEX3
months, O
" O
said O
Kenneth O
Warren O
, O
a O

" O
The O
golden O
share O
is O
a O
single O
share O
, O
but O
it O
is O
the O
magic O
share O
. O

" O
The O
government O
retained O
the O
single O
share O
after O
selling O
its O
stake O
in O
Jaguar O
in O
1984 B-TIMEX3
- O
- O
part O
of O
a O
nationalistic O
practice O
of O
protecting O
former O
government-owned O
enterprises O
to O
deflect O
criticism O
of O
privatization O
. O

The O
15% O
restriction O
covers O
any O
would-be O
suitor O
, O
British O
or O
foreign O
. O

Ford O
is O
willing O
to O
bid O
for O
100% O
of O
Jaguar O
's O
shares O
if O
both O
the O
government O
and O
Jaguar O
shareholders O
agree O
to O
relax O
the O
anti-takeover O
barrier O
prematurely O
. O

As O
Jaguar O
's O
biggest O
holder O
and O
Britain O
's O
biggest O
car O
maker O
, O
Ford O
could O
turn O
up O
the O
heat O
by O
convening O
a O
special O
shareholders O
' O
meeting O
and O
urging O
holders O
to O
drop O
the O
limits O
early O
. O

Ford O
might O
succeed O
because O
many O
shareholders O
are O
speculators O
keen O
for O
a O
full O
bid O
or O
institutional O
investors O
unhappy O
over O
Jaguar O
management O
's O
handling O
of O
its O
current B-TIMEX3
financial O
difficulties O
. O

The O
government O
probably O
would O
n't O
give O
in O
readily O
to O
a O
hostile O
foray O
by O
Ford O
, O
however O
. O

It O
has O
relinquished O
a O

in O
1988 B-TIMEX3
. O

In O
wooing O
British O
lawmakers O
, O
GM O
has O
pointed O
out O
that O
its O
willingness O
to O
settle O
for O
a O
minority O

would O
keep O
Jaguar O
British-owned O

the B-TIMEX3

Some O
fund O
managers O
say O
negative O
publicity O
has O
exacerbated O
investors O
' O
concern O
about O
recent B-TIMEX3
declines O
in O
junk-bond O
prices O
. O

" O
People O
have O
been O
seeing O
headline O
after O
headline O
after O
headline O
and O
saying O
: O
` O
I O
ca O
n't O
take O
it O
anymore O
- O
- O
I O
'm O
getting O
out,' O
" O
says O
Kurt O
Brouwer O
of O
Brouwer O
amp O
Janachowski O
, O
a O
San O
Francisco O
investment O
adviser O
. O

The O
withdrawals O
could O
spell O
trouble O
for O
the O
$200 O
billion O
junk O
market O
. O

If O
the O
heavy O
outflows O
continue O
, O
fund O
managers O
will O
face O
increasing O
pressure O
to O
sell O
off O
some O
of O
their O
junk O
to O
pay O
departing O
investors O
in O
the B-TIMEX3
weeks I-TIMEX3
ahead I-TIMEX3
. O

Such O
selling O
could O
erode O
prices O
of O
high-yield O
junk O
bonds O
, O
already O
weakened O
by O
a O
rash O
of O
corporate O
credit O
problems O
. O

Mutual O
fund O
groups O
have O
n't O
lost O
control O
of O
much O
of O
the O
outgoing O
money O
, O
says O
Louis O
Harvey O
, O
Dalbar O
's O
president O
. O

Mutual O
fund O
officials O
say O
that O
investors O
have O
transferred O
most O
of O
it O
into O
their O
money O
market O
accounts O
, O
and O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent O
, O
government-bond O
funds O
. O

So O
the O
impact O
on O
the O
$950 O
billion O
mutual O
fund O
industry O
as O
a O
whole O
probably O
will O
be O
slight O
. O

But O
tremors O
are O
likely O
in O
the O
junk-bond O
market O
, O
which O
has O
helped O
to O
finance O
the O
takeover O
boom O
of O
recent B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3

Mutual O

are O
the O
among O
the O

, O
accounting O
for O
more O
than O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O

Many O

" O
The O
government O
is O
sharpening O
its O

weapon O
against O
white-collar O
defendants O
: O
the O
power O
to O
prevent O
them O
from O
paying O
their O

bills O
. O

are O
warning O
that O
they O
wo O
n't O
stick O
around O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
get O
paid O
. O

The O
issue O
has O
come O
to O
a O
boil O
in O
Newark O
, O
N.J. O
, O
where O
federal O
prosecutors O
have O
warned O
lawyers O
for O
Eddie O
Antar O
that O
if O
the O
founder O
and O
former O
chairman O
of O
Crazy O
Eddie O
Inc. O
is O
indicted O
, O
the O
government O
may O
move O
to O
seize O
the O
money O
that O
Mr. O
Antar O
is O
using O
to O
pay O
legal O
fees O
. O

The O
warning O
by O
the O
U.S. O
attorney O
's O
office O
follows O
two O
decisions O
by O
the O
U.S. O
Supreme O
Court O
last B-TIMEX3
June I-TIMEX3
. O

In O
those O
cases O
, O
the O
high O
court O
ruled O
that O
federal O
law O
gives O
prosecutors O
broad O
authority O
to O
seize O
assets O
of O
people O
accused O
of O
racketeering O
and O
drug-related O
crimes O
, O
including O
fees O
paid O
to O
lawyers O
before O
an O
indictment O
. O

If O
the O
government O
succeeds O
in O
seizing O
Mr. O
Antar O
's O
assets O
, O
he O
could O
be O
left O
without O
top-flight O
legal O
representation O
, O
because O
his O
attorneys O
are O
likely O
to O
quit O
, O
according O
to O
individuals O
familiar O
with O
the O
case O
. O

A O
seizure O
also O
would O
make O
the O
case O
the O
largest O
- O
- O
and O
one O
of O
the O
first O
- O
- O
in O
which O
lawyers O
' O
fees O
have O
been O
confiscated O
in O
a O
prosecution O
unrelated O
to O
drugs O
. O

" O
The O
people O
who O
suffer O
in O
the O
short O
run O
are O
defendants O
, O
but O
the O
people O
who O
suffer O
in O
the O
long O
run O
are O
all O
of O
the O
people O
, O
because O
there O
wo O
n't O
be O
a O
vigorous O
private O
bar O
to O
defend O
the O
Bill O
of O
Rights, O
" O
says O
Gerald O
Lefcourt O
, O
a O
criminal O
defense O
attorney O
who O
says O
he O
has O
turned O
down O
a O
number O
of O
cases O
to O
avoid O
possible O
fee O
seizures O
. O

Mr. O
Antar O
is O
being O
investigated O
by O
a O
federal O
grand O
jury O
in O
Newark O
, O
where O
prosecutors O
have O
told O
him O
that O
they O
may O
soon B-TIMEX3
seek O
an O
indictment O
on O
racketeering O
and O
securities O
fraud O
charges O
. O

Under O
the O
Racketeer O
Influenced O
and O
Corrupt O
Organizations O
law O
, O
or O
RICO O
, O
the O
government O
has O
the O
authority O
to O
seek O
to O
freeze O
or O
seize O
a O
defendant O
's O
assets O
before O
trial O
. O

According O
to O
individuals O
familiar O
with O
Mr. O
Antar O
's O
case O
, O
prosecutors O
issued O
their O
warning O
this B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
after O
one O
of O
Mr. O
Antar O
's O
attorneys O
asked O
whether O
legal O
fees O
might O
be O
subject O
to O
seizure O
. O

In O
a O
letter O
, O
prosecutors O
told O
Mr. O
Antar O
's O
lawyers O
that O
because O
of O
the O
recent B-TIMEX3
Supreme O
Court O
rulings O
, O
they O
could O
expect O
that O
any O
fees O
collected O
from O
Mr. O
Antar O
may O
be O
seized O
. O

Prosecutors O
have O
told O
Mr. O
Antar O
's O
attorneys O
that O
they O
believe O
Mr. O
Antar O
's O
allegedly O
ill-gotten O
gains O
are O
so O
great O
that O
any O
money O
he O
has O
used O
to O
pay O
attorneys O
derives O
from O
illegal O
activities O
. O

Therefore O
, O
they O
said O
, O
the O
money O
can O
be O
taken O
from O
the O
lawyers O
even O
after O
they O
are O
paid O
. O

Justin O
Feldman O
and O
Jack O
Arseneault O
, O
attorneys O
for O
Mr. O
Antar O
, O
both O
declined O
to O
comment O
on O
the O
matter O
. O

In O
Newark O
, O
U.S. O
Attorney O
Samuel O
A. O
Alito O
said O
, O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
there O
's O
any O
legal O
reason O
to O
limit O
forfeiture O
of O

cases O

" O
Mr. O
Alito O
said O
his O

" O
just O
responded O
to O
an O
attorney O

question O
about O
whether O
we O
would O
go O

that O

" O
Mr. O
Antar O
was O
charged O
last B-TIMEX3
month I-TIMEX3
in O
a O
civil O
suit O
filed O
in O
federal O
court O
in O
Newark O
by O
the O
Securities O

Exchange O
Commission O
. O

In O
that O
suit O
, O
the O
SEC O
accused O
Mr. O

of O
engaging O
in O
a O
" O
massive O
financial O
fraud O
" O

the O

Through O
his O

Mr. O

SEC O
suit O

in O
civil O
suits O
previously O
filed O
by O
shareholders O
against O
Mr. O

The O
SEC O
has O
alleged O
that O

aimed O
to O
pump O
up O
the O
company O

stock O
price O
through O
false O
financial O
statements O
in O
order O
to O
sell O
his O

and O
reap O
huge O
profits O
. O

Mr. O
Antar O
, O
the O
SEC O
said O
, O
made O
more O
than O
$60 O
million O
from O
the O
sale O
of O
his O
shares O
between O
1985 B-TIMEX3
and O
1987 B-TIMEX3
. O

The O
Justice O
Department O
has O
emphasized O
that O
the O
government O
's O
fee-forfeiture O
power O
is O
to O
be O
used O
sparingly O
. O

According O
to O
department O
policy O
, O
prosecutors O
must O
make O
a O
strong O
showing O
that O
lawyers O
' O
fees O
came O
from O
assets O
tainted O
by O
illegal O
profits O
before O
any O
attempts O
at O
seizure O
are O
made O
. O

Still O
, O
criminal O
defense O
lawyers O
worry O
that O

their O
Sixth O
Amendment O
right O

trial O
if O

They O
also O
worry O
that O
if O
the O

the O

the O
" O
bugs O
" O
are O
n't O
expected O

hurt O
Intel O

most O

Computer O
experts O
familiar O
with O
the O
flaws O
, O
found O
in O
Intel O

80486 O
chip O
, O
say O
the O
defects O
do O
n't O
affect O
the O
average O
user O
and O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
cleared O
up O
before O
most O

their O
" O

" O
appear O
on O
the O

sometime B-TIMEX3
next I-TIMEX3

. O

Intel O
said O
that O
last B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
a O
customer O
discovered O
two O
flaws O
in O
its O
80486 O
microprocessor O
chip O
's O
" O
floating-point O
unit O
" O
, O
a O
set O
of O
circuits O
that O
do O
certain O
calculations O
. O

On O
Friday B-TIMEX3
, O
Intel O
began O
notifying O
customers O
about O
the O
bugs O
which O
cause O
the O
chip O
to O
give O
wrong O
answers O
for O
some O
mathematical O
calculations O
. O

But O
while O
International O
Business O
Machines O
Corp. O
and O
Compaq O
Computer O
Corp. O
say O
the O
bugs O
will O
delay O
products O
, O
most O
big O
computer O
makers O
said O
the O
flaws O
do O
n't O
affect O
them O
. O

" O
Bugs O
like O
this O
are O
just O
a O
normal O
part O
of O
product O
development, O
" O
said O
Richard O
Archuleta O
, O
director O
of O
Hewlett-Packard O
Co. O
's O
advanced O
systems O
development O
. O

Hewlett O
announced O
last B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
that O
it O
planned O
to O
ship O
a O
computer O
based O
on O
the O
486 O
chip O
early B-TIMEX3
next I-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
. O

" O
These O
bugs O
do O
n't O
affect O
our O
schedule O
at O
all, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Likewise O
, O
AST O
Research O
Inc. O
and O
Sun O
Microsystems O
Inc. O
said O
the O
bugs O
wo O
n't O
delay O
their O
development O
of O
486-based O
machines O
. O

" O
We O
have O
n't O
modified O
our O
schedules O
in O
any O
way, O
" O
said O
a O
Sun O
spokesman O
. O

To O
switch O
to O
another O
vendor O
's O
chips O
, O
" O
would O
not O
definitely O
be O
an O
option, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
concern O
about O
the O
chip O
may O
have O
been O
responsible O
for O
a O
decline O
of O
87.5 O
cents O
in O
Intel O
's O
stock O
to O
$32 O
a O

yesterday B-TIMEX3
in O
over-the-counter O
trading O
, O
on O
volume O
of O
3,609,800 O
shares O
, O
and O
partly O
responsible O
for O
a O
drop O
in O
Compaq O

in O
New O

on O

Yesterday B-TIMEX3

Compaq O
plunged O
further O

, O
off O
$8.625 O
a O

, O
on O
volume O
of O
2,633,700 O

Most O
of O
Compaq O

is O
being O
attributed O
to O
a O
third-quarter B-TIMEX3
earnings O
report O
that O
came O
in O
at O
the O
low O
end O
of O
analysts O
' O
expectations O
. O

Intel O
said O
it O
had O
corrected O
the O
problems O
and O
would O
start O
producing O
bugless O
chips O
next B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
. O

" O
We O
should O
not O
be O
seeing O
any O
more, O
" O
said O
Bill O
Rash O
, O
Intel O
's O
director O
for O
the O
486 O
chip O
. O

What O
's O
more O
, O
the O
bugs O
only O
emerge O
on O
esoteric O
applications O
such O
as O
computer-aided O
design O
and O
scientific O
calculations O
, O
he O
said O
, O
and O
then O
very O
seldom O
. O

" O
These O
errata O
do O
not O
affect O
business O
programs, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

The O
bugs O
will O
cause O
problems O
in O
" O
specific O
and O
rare O
circumstances O
that O
will O
not O
occur O
in O
typical O
applications O
" O
such O
as O
word-processing O
and O
spreadsheets O
, O
said O
Michael O
Slater O
, O
editor O
of O
the O
Microprocessor O
Report O
, O
an O
industry O
newsletter O
. O

Sun O
, O
Hewlett-Packard O
and O
others O
say O
Intel O
is O
n't O
wholly O
to O
blame O
for O
the O
snafu O
. O

The O
real O
culprits O
, O
they O
said O
, O
are O
computer O
makers O
such O
as O
IBM O
that O
have O
jumped O
the O
gun O
to O
unveil O
486-based O
products O
. O

" O
The O
reason O
this O
is O
getting O
so O
much O
visibility O
is O
that O
some O
started O
shipping O
and O
announced O
early O
availability, O
" O
said O
Hewlett-Packard O
's O
Mr. O
Archuleta O
. O

" O
You O
can O
do O
that O
but O
you O
're O
taking O
a O
risk O
. O

Those O
companies O
are O
paying O
the O
price O
for O
taking O
the O
risk O
. O

" O
In O
late B-TIMEX3
September I-TIMEX3
, O
IBM O
began O
shipping O
a O
plug-in O
card O
that O
converts O
its O
PS/2 O
model O
70-A21 O
from O
a O
80386 O
machine O
to O
an O
80486 O
machine O
. O

An O
IBM O
spokeswoman O
said O
the O
company O
told O
customers O
Monday B-TIMEX3
about O
the O
bugs O
and O
temporarily O
stopped O
shipping O
the O
product O
. O

IBM O
has O
no O
plans O
to O
recall O
its O
add-on O
cards O
, O
the O
spokeswoman O
said O
, O
and O
could O
probably O
circumvent O
the O
bugs O
without O
long O
product O
delays O
. O

" O
We O
do O
n't O
look O
at O
this O
as O
a O
major O
problem O
for O
us, O
" O
she O
said O
. O

Compaq O
, O
which O
said O
it O
discovered O
the O
bugs O
, O
still O
plans O
to O
announce O
new O
486 O
products O
on O
Nov. B-TIMEX3
6 I-TIMEX3
. O

Because O
of O
the O
glitch O
, O
however O
, O
the O
company O
said O
it O
does O
n't O
know O
when O
its O
machine O
will O
be O
commercially O
available O
. O

That O
's O
a O
break O
from O
Compaq O
tradition O
, O
because O
the O
company O
does O
n't O
announce O
products O
until O
they O
're O
actually O
at O
the O
dealers O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
being O
ballyhooed O
, O
experts O
say O
, O
because O
the O
486 O
is O
Intel O
's O
future O
flagship O
. O

Intel O
's O
microprocessors O
are O
the O
chips O
of O
choice O
in O
many O
of O
today O
's O
personal O
computers O
and O
the O
80486 O
microprocessor O
is O
the O
spearhead O
of O
the O
company O
's O
bid O
to O
guard O
that O
spot O
in O
the O
next O
generation O
of O
machines O
. O

" O
Although O
these O
sorts O
of O
bugs O
are O
not O
at O
all O
uncommon O
, O
the O
486 O
is O
an O
extremely O
high-profile O
product, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Slater O
, O
the O
newsletter O
editor O
. O

Intel O
's O
80486 O
chip O
is O
the O
Corvette O
of O
Intel O
's O
microprocessors O
, O
a O
super-fast O
, O
super-expensive O
chip O
that O
only O
the O
most O
power-hungry O
computer O
users O
are O
likely O
to O
buy O
for O
at O
least O
several B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
. O

Unveiled O
last B-TIMEX3
April I-TIMEX3
, O
the O
chip O
crams O
1.2 O
million O
transistors O
on O
a O
sliver O
of O
silicon O
, O
more O
than O
four O
times O
as O
many O
as O
on O
Intel O
's O
earlier O
model O
, O
80386 O
. O

Intel O
clocks O
the O
chip O
's O
speed O
at O
15 O
million O
instructions O
per O
second O
, O
or O
MIPs O
. O

That O
's O
four O
times O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
386 O
. O

Machines O
using O
the O
486 O
are O
expected O
to O
challenge O
higher-priced O
work O
stations O
and O
minicomputers O
in O
applications O
such O
as O
so-called O
servers O
, O
which O
connect O
groups O
of O
computers O
together O
, O
and O
in O
computer-aided O
design O
. O

But O
while O
the O
chip O
's O
speed O
in O
processing O
power O
is O
dazzling O
, O
it O
's O
real O
strength O
lies O
in O
its O
software O
inheritance O
. O

The O
486 O
is O
the O
descendant O
of O
a O
long O
series O
of O
Intel O
chips O
that O
began O
dominating O
the O
market O
ever O
since O
IBM O
picked O
the O
16-bit O
8088 O
chip O
for O
its O
first O
personal O
computer O
. O

( O
A O
16-bit O
microprocessor O
processes O
16 O
pieces O
of O
data O
at O
a O
time O
and O
is O
slower O
than O
newer O
, O
32-bit O
chips O
. O

) O
Since O
then O
, O
Intel O
has O
cornered O
a O
large O
part O
of O
the O
market O
with O
successive O
generations O
of O
16-bit O
and O
32-bit O
chips O
, O
all O
of O
which O
can O
run O
software O
written O
for O
previous O
models O
. O

That O
's O
what O
will O
keep O
computer O
makers O
coming O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
irritation O
of O
bugs O
. O

Big O
personal O
computer O
makers O
and O
many O
makers O
of O
engineering O
workstations O
are O
developing O
486-based O
machines O
, O
which O
are O
expected O
to O
reach O
the O

Chairman O
Marc O
Fournier O
said O
his O
board O
unanimously O
rejected O
as O
too O
low O
the O
$1.77 O
billion O
bid O
by O
Cie. O
Financiere O
de O

to O
bring O
its O
stake O

to O
66.7% O
. O

At O
a O
news O
conference O
, O
Mr. O
Fournier O
accused O
Paribas O
of O
planning O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
takeover O
by O
selling O
parts O
of O
the O
company O
, O
whose O
interests O
include O
insurance O
, O
banking O
, O
tuna O
canning O
, O
sugar O
and O
orange O
juice O
. O

The O
chairman O
said O
his O
board O
members O
, O
including O
representatives O
of O
West O
German O
insurance O
giant O
Allianz O
AG O
and O
French O
banks O
Credit O
Lyonnais O
and O
Societe O
Generale O
, O
hold O
nearly O
50% O
of O
Navigation O
Mixte O
's O
capital O
. O

Mr. O
Fournier O
said O
that O
as O
Navigation O
Mixte O
chairman O
, O
he O
is O
prohibited O
by O
takeover O
regulations O
from O
organizing O
his O
own O
defense O
or O
doing O
anything O
besides O
managing O
current O
company O
business O
. O

But O
sources O
said O
he O
will O
be O
urging O
his O
allies O
to O
boost O
their O
stakes O
in O
Navigation O
Mixte O
, O
which O
is O
being O
traded O
in O
London O
and O
is O
to O
resume O
trading O
in O
Paris O
Tuesday B-TIMEX3
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
he O
is O
expected O
to O
seek O
legal O
and O
regulatory O
means O
of O
blocking O
or O
delaying O
Paribas O
's O
bid O
. O

For O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
sources O
said O
, O
he O
has O
decided O
against O
seeking O
a O
white O
knight O
or O
organizing O
a O
counterbid O
for O
Paribas O
. O

Mr. O
Fournier O
said O
Navigation O
Mixte O
's O
1989 B-TIMEX3
unconsolidated O
, O
or O
parent-company O
, O
profit O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
4.7 O
billion O
francs O
( O
$754.4 O
million O
) O
, O
up O
from O
633.8 O
million O
francs O
last B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
. O

That O
is O
due O
mostly O
to O
payments O
from O
Allianz O
for O
most O
of O
the O
50% O
stake O
it O
has O
agreed O
to O
acquire O
in O
Navigation O
Mixte O
's O
insurance O
business O
. O

Mr. O
Fournier O
said O
the O
exceptional O
gain O
would O
mean O
nearly O
twice O
as O
high O
a O
dividend O
this B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
as O
last B-TIMEX3
. O

If O
holders O
avoid O
tendering O
to O
Paribas O
, O
he O
added O
, O
they O
can O
expect O
strong O
dividends O
again O
next B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
. O

Analysts O
noted O
that O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
past I-TIMEX3
20 I-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
, O
Mr. O
Fournier O
has O
built O
his O
company O
through O
astute O
stock-market O
activity O
and O
has O
warded O
off O
at O
least O
three O
takeover O
attempts O
. O

This O
time O
, O
however O
, O
some O
analysts O
think O
he O
could O
face O
a O
real O
battle O
. O

" O
Without O
some O
unexpected O
" O
coup O
de O
theatre O
" O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
what O
will O
block O
the O
Paribas O
bid, O
" O
said O
Philippe O
de O
Cholet O
, O
analyst O
at O
the O
brokerage O
Cholet-Dupont O
amp O
Cie. O
Mr. O
de O
Cholet O
said O
Mr. O
Fournier O
's O
biggest O
hope O
was O
to O
somehow O
persuade O
regulatory O
authorities O
to O
block O
the O
bid O
. O

Paribas O
still O
needs O
the O
go-ahead O
from O
the O
Commission O
des O
Operations O
de O
Bourse O
, O
a O
government O
regulatory O
agency O
, O
but O
analysts O
said O
that O
is O
considered O
likely O
. O

Mr. O
Fournier O
also O
noted O
that O
Navigation O
Mixte O
joined O
Paribas O
's O
core O
of O
shareholders O
when O
Paribas O
was O
denationalized O
in O
1987 B-TIMEX3
, O
and O
said O
it O
now B-TIMEX3
holds O
just O
under O
5% O
of O
Paribas O
's O
shares O
. O

Once O
he O
realized O
that O
Paribas O
's O
intentions O
were O
n't O
friendly O
, O
he O
said O
, O
but O
before O
the O
bid O
was O
launched O
, O
he O
sought O
approval O
to O
boost O
his O
Paribas O
stake O
above O
10% O
. O

The O
petition O
is O
still O
pending O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Fournier O
downplayed O
the O
likelihood O
of O
his O
organizing O
a O
takeover O
bid O
of O
his O
own O
for O
the O
much-larger O
Paribas O
. O

One O
big O
question O
now O
is O
the O
likely O
role O
of O
Mr. O
Fournier O
's O
allies O
. O

Mr. O
Fournier O
said O
the O
large O
institutions O
that O
hold O
nearly O
50% O
of O
Navigation O
Mixte O
's O
capital O
all O
strongly O
support O
him O
, O
but O
some O
analysts O
said O
they O
are O
n't O
so O
sure O
. O

Allianz O
, O
for O
example O
, O
has O
said O
in O
official O
comments O
so O
far O
that O
it O
will O
remain O
neutral O
. O

Paribas O
is O
Allianz O
's O
lead O
French O
bank O
. O

Paribas O
said O
Monday B-TIMEX3
that O
it O
intends O
to O
bid O
to O
boost O
its O
stake O
in O
Navigation O
Mixte O
to O
66.7% O
, O
from O
the O
18.7% O
it O
already O
owns O
. O

The O
purchase O
of O
the O
additional O
48% O
stake O
is O
expected O
to O
cost O
more O
than O
11 O
billion O
francs O
( O
$1.77 O
billion O
) O
. O

Paribas O
says O
it O
will O
offer O
1,850 O
francs O
( O
$296.95 O
) O
each O
for O
Navigation O
Mixte O
shares O
that O
enjoy O
full O
dividend O
rights O
, O
and O
1,800 O
francs O
each O
for O
a O
block O
of O

which O
will O
receive O
only O

Alternatively O

. O

The O
Paribas O
offer O
values O

at O
about O

in O

The O

a O
key O
measure O

Although O

2.5% O
in O
the B-TIMEX3

In O
a O
statement O
, O
Scott O
McNealy O
, O
Sun O
's O
chief O
executive O
officer O
, O
said O
the O
company O
's O
performance O
was O
hampered O
by O
problems O
tied O
to O
the O
introduction O
of O
a O
major O
new O
family O
of O
computers O
in O
April B-TIMEX3
. O

One O
of O
those O
new O
computers O
, O
called O
Sparcstation O
1 O
, O
accounted O
for O
nearly O
half O
of O
the O
28,000 O
systems O
Sun O
shipped O
in O
the B-TIMEX3
quarter I-TIMEX3
, O
he O
said O
. O

More O
than O
two-thirds O
of O
the O
systems O
shipped O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
were O
products O
introduced O
in O
April B-TIMEX3
. O

But O
problems O
in O
manufacturing O
, O
forecasting O
demand O
and O
getting O
the O
bugs O
out O
of O
a O
new O
management O
information O
system O
made O
it O
extremely O
difficult O
for O
Sun O
to O
meet O
demand O
for O
its O
newest O
computers O
well O
into O
the B-TIMEX3
summer I-TIMEX3
. O

These O
problems O
also O
resulted O
in O
Sun O
reporting O
a O
$20.3 O
million O
loss O
for O
its B-TIMEX3
fourth I-TIMEX3
quarter I-TIMEX3
ended O
June B-TIMEX3
30 I-TIMEX3
. O

Mr. O
McNealy O
said O
the O
issues O
that O
hurt O
Sun O
's O
performance O
earlier O
this B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
are O
now O
" O
largely O
" O
behind O
the O
firm O
, O
and O
he O
indicated O
that O
Sun O
's O
profitability O
should O
increase O
throughout O
the B-TIMEX3
fiscal I-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
. O

Sun O
also O
reported O
a O
record O
backlog O

. O

While O
this O
indicates O
continued O
strong O

for O
the O

, O
Sun O
faces O
increasing O
competition O
from O
Digital O
Equipment O

and O
Hewlett-Packard O
Co. O
Recently B-TIMEX3
, O
analysts O
have O
said O
Sun O
also O

from O

, O
which O
plans O
to O
introduce O

said O
the O
company O

, O
Garth O
Drabinsky O
, O
is O
considering O
bidding O
780.6 O

( O

The O

Mr. O

all O

. O

The O
directors O
added O
that O
the O
two O
executives O
have O
n't O
reached O
a O
final O
decision O
to O
proceed O
with O
a O
bid O
and O
that O
until O
an O
offer O
is O
made O
the O
board O
will O
continue O
seeking O
higher O
offers O
from O
other O
bidders O
. O

The O
directors O
said O
if O
Messrs. O
Drabinsky O
and O
Gottlieb O
mail O
an O
offer O
to O
shareholders O
by O
Nov. B-TIMEX3
22 I-TIMEX3
, O
it O
will O
reimburse O
them O
a O
maximum O
of O
C$8.5 O
million O
for O

related O
to O
a O

. O

" O
We O
consider O
that O
his O
bid O
is O
an O
acceptable O
bid, O
" O
said O
Sandra O
Kolber O
, O
spokeswoman O
for O
the O
independent O
directors O
' O
committee O
appointed O
last B-TIMEX3
May I-TIMEX3
to O
solicit O
and O
review O
bids O
for O
the O
company O
in O
the O
wake O
of O
a O
dispute O
between O
Mr. O
Drabinsky O

major O

MCA O
Inc. O
MCA O

other O

, O
Montreal-based O
financier O
Charles O
Bronfman O
and O
his O

, O
have O
agreed O
to O
tender O
their O
holdings O
to O
an O
offer O
by O
Mr. O
Drabinsky O
unless O
a O
higher O
offer O
is O
made O
by O
another O
bidder O
. O

MCA O
holds O
half O
of O
Cineplex O
's O
equity O
and O
33% O
of O
its O
voting O
rights O
through O
restricted O
voting O
shares O
, O
while O
Bronfman O
interests O
hold O
about O
24% O
of O
the O
company O
's O
equity O
. O

Ms. O
Kolber O
said O
the O
committee O
had O
received O
other O
bids O
. O

She O
declined O
to O
identify O
other O
bidders O
but O
said O
Mr. O
Drabinsky O
's O
offer O
" O
is O
all O
cash O
, O
and O
it O
's O
for O
all O
of O
the O
company O
. O

" O
Several O
Cineplex O
analysts O
have O
speculated O
that O
outside O
bids O
received O
by O
the O
committee O
were O
either O
disappointingly O
low O
or O
for O
only O
part O
of O
the O
company O
. O

" O
All O
this O
has O
really O
established O
is O
that O
MCA O
and O
the O
Bronfmans O
have O
agreed O
on O
a O
price O
at O
which O
they O
can O
be O
bought O
out, O
" O
said O
Jeffery O
Logsdon O
, O
an O
analyst O
with O
Crowell O
, O
Weedon O
in O
Los O
Angeles O
. O

" O
If O
a O
bid O
materializes O
at O
that O
price O
, O
shareholders O
will O
have O
every O
reason O
to O
be O
glad O
, O
but O
the O
question O
of O
financing O
still O
remains O
. O

" O
Last B-TIMEX3
April I-TIMEX3
, O
Mr. O
Drabinsky O

a O

a O

Mr. O

would O
have O
had O
the O
right O

for O
two B-TIMEX3

, O
said O
the O
purchase O
, O
subsequently O
rejected O
by O
regulators O
, O
was O
aimed O
at O
consolidating O
his O
control O
of O
the O
company O
. O

MCA O
strongly O
opposed O
the O
Drabinsky O
group O

move O
. O

The O
directors O
did O
n't O
indicate O
the O
source O
of O
financing O
for O
Mr. O
Drabinsky O

new O
proposal O
, O
but O
said O
MCA O

agreed O
in O
principle O
to O
buy O

18-screen O

For O

said O
the O

may O
branch O
out O

as O

Thomas O
Spiegel O

Columbia O

said O
in O
a O

that O
the O

" O
disappointed O
" O
by O
the O

of O
the O

. O

But O
he O
said O
Columbia O
remains O
" O
one O
of O
the O
most O
strongly O
capitalized O
thrifts O
in O
the O

" O
based O
on O
the O

The O
price O

Columbia O

has O
been O
cut O
nearly O
in O
half O
since O
August B-TIMEX3
, O
when O
they O
traded O
at O
about O
$10 O
, O
as O
investors O
apparently O
realized O
that O
the O

would O
be O
forced O
to O
take O
a O
big O
write-down O

Columbia O
officials O
said O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
quickly O
they O
will O
dispose O
of O
the O
thrift O

junk O

, O
because O
federal O

, O
such O

those O
that O

continue O

, O
have O
n't O
yet O
been O

Columbia O
officials O
also O
said O
the O
thrift O
should O
n't O
face O
problems O
meeting O
regulatory O
capital O
requirements O
, O
despite O
the O
large O
reserves O
and O
write-downs O
and O
stiffer O
regulatory O

that O

be O
in O

Its O

, O
and O

The O
thrift O
emphasized O
that O
it O
has O
a O
large O
portfolio O
of O

securities O
issued O
in O

with O
corporate O
restructurings O
and O

, O

Although O
many O
of O
the O
transactions O
related O
to O
those O
securities O
have O
n't O
been O
completed O
, O
Columbia O
said O
the O
ultimate O
gain O
on O
the O
sale O
of O
those O
assets O
will O
range O
from O
$200 O
million O
to O
$300 O

Columbia O
also O
has O

has O
historically O
been O

however O
, O
the O
once-sporadic O

standard O

expected O

with O

Beneath O

projected O
that O
Anheuser O

a O

of O
warning O

to O
ease O
up O

or O

a O

Mr. O

disappointing O
earnings O
, O
which O
fell O
five O
cents O

short O

But O
Smith O
Barney O

Mr. O

" O
While O
the O
third-quarter B-TIMEX3

Iraq O
's O
Saddam O
Hussein O
, O
his O
options O
for O
ending O
the O
Persian O
Gulf O
crisis O
growing O
increasingly O
unpleasant O
, O
assumed O
the O
role O
of O
embattled O
Arab O
hero O
in O
offering O
his O
first O
rough O
proposal O
for O
a O
negotiated O
end O
to O
the O
confrontation O
. O

The O
Iraqi O
leader O
, O
in O
an O
" O
initiative O
" O
designed O
as O
much O
to O
rally O
Arab O
public O
opinion O
as O
to O
launch O
meaningful O
negotiations O
, O
announced O
yesterday B-TIMEX3
that O
he O
will O
withdraw O
his O
troops O
from O
Kuwait O
only O
if O
Israel O
withdraws O
from O
the O
West O
Bank O
and O
Syria O
from O
Lebanon O
. O

He O
apparently O
hopes O
to O
lure O
support O
from O
Arabs O
who O
have O
spurned O
him O
so O
far O
by O
suggesting O
that O
Iraq O
will O
use O
its O
occupation O
of O
Kuwait O
as O
a O
lever O
to O
solve O
the O
Arab O
world O
's O
most O
frustrating O
problem O
, O
the O
23-year B-TIMEX3
Israeli O
occupation O
of O
land O
claimed O
by O
Palestinians O
. O

Even O
as O
Saddam O
Hussein O
was O
searching O
for O
a O
ploy O
to O
ease O
his O
isolation O
, O
though O
, O
the O
international O
pressure O
against O
him O
clicked O
up O
another O
notch O
. O

The O
White O
House O
yesterday B-TIMEX3
disclosed O
that O
Kuwait O
's O
ousted O
government O
has O
formally O
asked O
the O
U.S. O
to O
enforce O
the O
total O
trade O
embargo O
the O
United O
Nations O
has O
imposed O
on O
Iraq O
, O
allowing O
the O
U.S. O

to O
immediately O
begin O
stopping O

Secretary O
of O
State O
James O
Baker O
, O
speaking O
on O
ABC O
News O
' O
" O
This O
Week, O
" O
said O
the O
Kuwaiti O
request O
gives O
the O
U.S. O
and O
other O
countries O
" O
a O
legal O
basis O
for O
stopping O
the O
export O
of O
oil O
and O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O

" O
The O
U.S. O
maintains O
that O
under O
the O
U.N. O
charter O
, O
the O
Kuwaiti O
request O
triggers O
steps O
for O
the O
collective O
enforcement O
of O
international O
sanctions O
. O

Mr. O
Baker O
declined O
to O
use O
the O
word O
blockade O
, O
but O
said O
that O
" O
interdiction O
" O
of O
Iraqi O
shipments O
would O
begin O
" O
almost O
instantly O
. O

" O
In O
a O
statement O
, O
the O
White O
House O
said O
it O
would O
do O
" O
whatever O
is O
necessary O
" O
to O
ensure O
compliance O
with O
the O
sanctions O
. O

Other O
Bush O
administration O
officials O
said O
that O
the O
international O
naval O
force O
in O
the O
area O
- O
- O
consisting O
of O
American O
, O
British O
, O
French O
, O
Canadian O
, O
Soviet O
, O
German O
and O
Australian O
ships O
- O
- O
may O
be O
used O
both O
to O
stop O
oil O
exports O
from O
leaving O
Iraq O
and O
Kuwait O
and O
to O
stop O
shipments O
of O
food O
and O
other O
goods O
from O
going O
in O
. O

President O
Bush O
implied O
as O
much O
yesterday B-TIMEX3
when O
reporters O
asked O
whether O
the O
interdiction O
would O
apply O
to O
food O
. O

The O
president O
responded O
, O
" O
Everything O
, O
everything O
. O

" O
While O
shying O
away O
from O
actually O
using O
the O
word O
" O
blockade, O
" O
Mr. O
Bush O
acknowledged O
that O
the O
U.S. O
and O
others O
were O
trying O
to O
block O
shipping O
to O
Iraq O
. O

" O
No O
point O
getting O
into O
all O
these O
semantics, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
The O
main O
thing O
is O
to O
stop O
the O
oil O
from O
coming O
out O
of O
there O
. O

" O
The O
naval O
interdiction O
force O
is O
part O
of O
an O
overall O
American O
strategy O
that O
officials O
say O
is O
designed O
to O
leave O
the O
Iraqi O
leader O
with O
only O
the O
stark O
choice O
of O
backing O
out O
of O
Kuwait O
or O
launching O
new O
attacks O
to O
change O
his O
situation O
. O

Though O
they O
insist O
they O
are O
n't O
trying O
to O
lure O
Saddam O
Hussein O
into O
an O
attack O
, O
officials O
hope O
that O
if O
he O
strikes O
again O
, O
the O
U.S. O
and O
its O
allies O
will O
have O
such O
an O
impressive O
force O
in O
place O
in O
Saudi O
Arabia O
that O
they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
crush O
him O
in O
retaliation O
. O

Iraq O
's O
first O
option O
, O
of O
course O
, O
may O
be O
simply O
to O
sit O
tight O
and O
hope O
it O
can O
endure O
a O
trade O
embargo O
longer O
than O
the O
West O
can O
live O
without O
Iraqi O
and O
Kuwaiti O
oil O
. O

Speaking O
on O
the O
ABC O
program O
, O
Abdul O
Amir O
al-Anbari O
, O
Iraq O
's O
ambassador O
to O
the O
U.N. O
, O
asserted O
that O
an O
embargo O
on O
Iraq O
could O
plunge O
the O
U.S. O
into O
a O
" O
depression O
" O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
into O
an O
economic O
" O
crisis O
. O

" O
Iraq O
clearly O
is O
trying O
to O
woo O
back O
more O
Arab O
support O
in O
case O
the O
conflict O
drags O
on O
, O
hoping O
that O
its O
neighbors O
eventually O
will O
help O
it O
survive O
a O
prolonged O
war O
of O
economic O
attrition O
with O
the O
West O
. O

So O
Saddam O
Hussein O
on O
Friday B-TIMEX3
tried O
to O
scare O
other O
Arab O
leaders O
into O
supporting O
him O
by O
calling O
on O
Arabs O
to O
rise O
up O
in O
a O
holy O
war O
against O
leaders O
who O
invited O
American O
and O
other O
Western O
soldiers O
into O
Saudi O
Arabia O
to O
protect O
the O
oil-rich O
kingdom O
. O

Then O
yesterday B-TIMEX3
, O
he O
tried O
to O
entice O
Arab O
leaders O
with O
his O
proposal O
for O
a O
diplomatic O
solution O
linking O
his O
occupation O
of O
Kuwait O
with O
Israel O
's O
occupation O
of O
the O
West O
Bank O
. O

The O
proposal O
also O
called O
for O
replacing O
American O
and O
other O
Western O
troops O
in O
Saudi O
Arabia O
with O
Arab O
forces O
. O

The O
Bush O
administration O
immediately O
said O
it O
" O
categorically O
" O
rejects O
the O
proposals O
. O

And O
President O
Bush O
yesterday B-TIMEX3
, O
asked O
whether O
he O
was O
at O
least O
glad O
Iraq O
is O
discussing O
negotiations O
, O
replied O
: O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
anything O
to O
be O
pleasing O
in O
there O
at O
all O
. O

" O
American O
strategists O
are O
calculating O
, O
though O
, O
that O
the O
trade O
sanctions O
- O
- O
enforced O
by O
an O
effective O
though O
perhaps O
undeclared O
naval O
blockade O
- O
- O
will O
hold O
tightly O
enough O
to O
convince O
Iraq O
that O
it O
will O
lose O
in O
the O
long O
run O
by O
simply O
standing O
pat O
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
rather O
than O
go O
through O
the O
humiliation O
of O
backing O
out O
of O
Kuwait O
, O
the O
Iraqis O
might O
well O
conclude O
that O
they O
need O
to O
lash O
out O
in O
some O
way O
to O
shake O
things O
up O
. O

In O
that O
event O
, O
Saddam O
Hussein O
appears O
to O
have O
three O
choices O
. O

The O
first O
would O
be O
to O
launch O
the O
much-feared O
direct O
invasion O
of O
Saudi O
Arabia O
, O
hoping O
to O
seize O
some O
Saudi O
oil O
fields O
and O
improve O
his O
bargaining O
position O
. O

But O
that O
option O
is O
growing O
less O
and O
less O
likely O
as O
thousands O
of O
American O
, O
British O
, O
Egyptian O
, O
Syrian O
and O
Moroccan O
forces O
assemble O
in O
and O
around O
Saudi O
Arabia O
to O
protect O
the O
kingdom O
. O

The O
Saudis O
even O
have O
in O
their O
possession O
48 O
Kuwaiti O
jet O
fighters O
, O
virtually O
the O
entire O
Kuwaiti O
air O
force O
, O
which O
managed O
to O
escape O
the O
Iraqi O
invasion O
, O
Saudi O
officials O
said O
. O

The O
Saudi O
" O
window O
of O
vulnerability O
... O
is O
closing O
very O
fast, O
" O
Prince O
Bandar O
bin O
Sultan O
, O
the O
Saudi O
ambassador O
to O
Washington O
, O
said O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
weekend I-TIMEX3
. O

The O
second O
possibility O
would O
be O
to O
start O
a O
fight O
with O
Israel O
, O
in O
hopes O
that O
all O
Arabs O
would O
have O
to O
move O
behind O
Iraq O
in O
a O
fight O
against O
their O
common O
Israeli O
enemy O
. O

In O
such O
an O
event O
, O
Saddam O
Hussein O
also O
might O
calculate O
, O
the O
Saudis O
would O
be O
under O
pressure O
to O
kick O
out O
U.S. O
troops O
because O
of O
America O
's O
close O
ties O
with O
Israel O
. O

Iraq O
could O
start O
hostilities O
with O
Israel O
either O
through O
a O
direct O
attack O
or O
by O
attacking O
Jordan O
. O

Israel O
has O
publicly O
declared O
that O
it O
will O
respond O
to O
an O
Iraqi O
attack O
on O
Jordan O
because O
it O
wo O
n't O
allow O
Iraq O
's O
dangerous O
army O
to O
take O
control O
of O
Jordan O
's O
long O
border O
with O
Israel O
. O

Iraq O
's O
third O
attack O
option O
would O
be O
to O
start O
an O
undeclared O
war O
on O
the O
U.S. O
and O
other O
Western O
nations O
through O
terrorism O
. O

Two O
Middle O
East O
terrorists O
with O
records O
of O
successful O
attacks O
against O
Western O
targets O
, O
Abu O
Nidal O
and O
Abu O
Abbas O
, O
have O
ties O
to O
Baghdad O
. O

And O
even O
terrorist O
groups O
that O
opposed O
Iraq O
in O
its O
war O
with O
Iran O
show O
signs O
of O
swinging O
behind O
Saddam O
Hussein O
now B-TIMEX3
that O
he O
is O
in O
a O
confrontation O
with O
the O
U.S. O
And O
Iraq O
still O
has O
thousands O
of O
Americans O
and O
other O
Westerners O
under O
its O
control O
in O
Iraq O
and O
Kuwait O
. O

They O
are O
n't O
being O
allowed O
to O
leave O
and O
could O
become O
hostages O
. O

If O
Iraq O
chooses O
a O
simple O
war O
of O
nerves O
and O
economic O
attrition O
, O
the O
Bush O
administration O
knows O
a O
long O
stalemate O
could O
try O
the O
patience O
of O
the O
American O
public O
and O
the O
West O
in O
general O
, O
and O
could O
open O
the O
possibility O
that O
moderate O
Arabs O
- O
- O
even O
including O
Saudi O
Arabia O
- O
- O
might O
drop O
out O
of O
the O
effort O
against O
Iraq O
and O
accept O
some O
deal O
from O
Saddam O
Hussein O
. O

But O
U.S. O
officials O
have O
sized O
up O
Saddam O
Hussein O
as O
a O
man O
who O
, O
despite O
some O
recklessness O
, O
will O
back O
down O
if O
he O
must O
. O

" O
This O
is O
a O
guy O
who O
is O
impulsive O
, O
and O
therefore O
capable O
of O
big O
miscalculations, O
" O
says O
one O
senior O
administration O
official O
involved O
in O
managing O
the O
crisis O
. O

The O
official O
adds O
, O
though O
, O
that O
" O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
we O
think O
he O
is O
someone O
who O
is O
capable O
of O
rational O
judgments O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
power O
. O

And O
when O
he O
finds O
something O
is O
unprofitable O
, O
then O
one O
can O
see O
certain O
accommodations O
. O

" O
Thus O
, O
administration O
aides O
will O
be O
trying O
to O
calculate O
whether O
Saddam O
Hussein O
's O
proposed O
diplomatic O
formula O
for O
getting O
out O
of O
Kuwait O
represents O
the O
first O
sign O
he O
is O
searching O
for O
a O
way O
out O
or O
simply O
is O
a O
public O
relations O
stunt O
. O

There O
are O
disagreements O
among O
experts O
about O
how O
much O
pressure O
will O
be O
needed O
to O
make O
Saddam O
Hussein O
decide O
he O
's O
up O
against O
the O
wall O
and O
whether O
simple O
economic O
pressure O
will O
ever O
be O
enough O
. O

The O
biggest O
worry O
is O
that O
if O
he O
decides O
he O
needs O
a O
way O
out O
of O
his O
predicament O
but O
does O
n't O
see O
a O
face-saving O
method O
, O
he O
could O
lash O
out O
in O
dangerous O
and O
unpredictable O
ways O
. O

U.S. O
officials O
claim O
they O
already O
see O
signs O
Saddam O
Hussein O
is O
getting O
nervous O
. O

In O
the O
first O
days O
after O
President O
Bush O
announced O
the O
dispatching O
of O
U.S. O
troops O
, O
they O
note O
, O
the O
Iraqi O
leader O
made O
several O
nationwide O
addresses O
indirectly O
- O
- O
having O
them O
read O
by O
a O
television O
announcer O
. O

" O
That O
shows O
he O
's O
nervous O
about O
pinpointing O
his O
location O
, O
either O
because O
he O
's O
afraid O
we O
'll O
find O
him O
, O
or O
that O
internal O
enemies O
will, O
" O
says O
one O
U.S. O
official O
. O

The O
unpredictability O
of O
Iraq O
's O
leader O
is O
a O
principal O
reason O
the O
U.S. O
is O
going O
to O
such O
great O
lengths O
to O
build O
a O
mammoth O
force O
in O
and O
around O
Saudi O
Arabia O
. O

Pentagon O
officials O
say O
the O
goal O
is O
to O
put O
40,000 O
troops O
in O
the O
region O
by O
the B-TIMEX3
end I-TIMEX3
of I-TIMEX3
the I-TIMEX3
month I-TIMEX3
. O

But O
the O
administration O
is O
n't O
putting O
any O
upper O
limit O
on O
how O
high O
the O
force O
could O
go O
after O
that O
, O
calculating O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
mistake O
to O
underestimate O
and O
an O
advantage O
to O
keep O
Saddam O
Hussein O
guessing O
. O

U.S. O
commanders O
in O
charge O
of O
planning O
for O
Middle O
East O
crises O
have O
indicated O
in O
the B-TIMEX3
past I-TIMEX3
that O
they O
were O
capable O
of O
deploying O
as O
many O
as O
300,000 O
troops O
. O

And O
the O
U.S. O
is O
taking O
similar O
steps O
to O
ensure O
that O
its O
naval O
force O
is O
adequate O
to O
carry O
out O
a O
blockade O
of O
Iraq O
and O
support O
a O
war O
if O
necessary O
. O

Over O
the B-TIMEX3
weekend I-TIMEX3
, O
Pentagon O
officials O
confirmed O
reports O
that O
a O
fourth O
U.S. O
aircraft O
carrier O
- O
- O
the O
John O
F. O
Kennedy O
- O
- O
and O
its O
powerful O
group O
of O
support O
ships O
could O
head O
for O
the O
Middle O
East O
within O
a B-TIMEX3
few I-TIMEX3
days I-TIMEX3
. O

Three O
other O
carriers O
and O
their O
escort O
vessels O
already O
are O
stationed O
within O
striking O
distance O
of O
Iraq O
or O
are O
steaming O
toward O
the O
area O
. O

But O
unless O
the O
military O
situation O
changes O
drastically O
, O
military O
officials O
say O
, O
the O
most O
likely O
plan O
will O
be O
for O
the O
Kennedy O
to O
eventually O
replace O
the O
carrier O
Dwight O
D. O
Eisenhower O
, O
which O
has O
been O
on O
patrol O
since O
March B-TIMEX3
and O
was O
scheduled O
to O
return O
to O
port O
before O
hostilities O
erupted O
in O
Kuwait O
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O

is O
progressing O

dramatic O
success, O
" O
said O
a O
buoyant O
Gen. O
Norman O
Schwarzkopf O
, O
commander O
of O
U.S. O
forces O
. O

Similarly O
, O
while O
cautioning O
about O
the O
uncertainty O
of O
early O
battle O
reports O
, O
White O
House O
spokesman O
Marlin O
Fitzwater O
said O
late B-TIMEX3
yesterday I-TIMEX3
that O
" O
the O
operation O
has O
been O
very O
successful O
. O

" O
Amid O
reports O
that O
thousands O
of O
Iraqi O
soldiers O
had O
surrendered O
, O
administration O
aides O
were O
also O
upbeat O
in O
private O
, O
with O
one O
even O
talking O
of O
victory O
within O
a O
week O
. O

But O
even O
continued O
military O
success O
carries O
political O
and O
diplomatic O
risks O
for O
President O
Bush O
and O
the O
U.S. O
The O
allied O
rejection O
of O
the O
last-minute O
Soviet-led O
diplomatic O
effort O
to O
avoid O
the O
ground O
war O
enabled O
Mr. O
Bush O
to O
seize O
the O
initiative O
from O
an O
Iraq O
seemingly O
bent O
on O
dictating O
peace O
terms O
. O

But O
it O
has O
offended O
some O
, O
especially O
in O
Arab O
countries O
, O
who O
now O
believe O
that O
Mr. O
Bush O
's O
real O
objectives O
are O
the O
demise O
of O
Saddam O
Hussein O
and O
the O
destruction O
of O
the O
Iraqi O
military O
, O
not O
just O
the O
liberation O
of O
Kuwait O
. O

" O
Why O
have O
a O
war O
? O

" O
asked O
Abdul O
Latif O
Shekar O
, O
a O
customs O
officer O
in O
Egypt O
, O
a O
country O
participating O
in O
the O
attack O
on O
Iraqi O
troops O
. O

" O
I O
think O
the O
Gorbachev O
plan O
was O
a O
good O
one O
. O

Iraq O
was O
ready O
to O
withdraw O
. O

" O
Now O
, O
he O
says O
, O
" O
it O
looks O
like O
the O
West O
just O
wants O
to O
destroy O
Iraq O
. O

" O
Despite O
the O
early O
indications O
of O
success O
, O
the O
allied O
forces O
could O
still O
suffer O
greater O
casualties O
and O
become O
bogged O
down O
militarily O
, O
especially O
when O
they O
encounter O
the O
tough O
Republican O
Guard O
, O
which O
is O
entrenched O
along O
the O
Iraq-Kuwait O
border O
. O

If O
so O
, O
and O
if O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
American O
goal O
actually O
is O
to O
destroy O
the O
Iraqi O
regime O
even O
at O
the O
cost O
of O
badly O
hurting O
Iraqi O
society O
, O
" O
the O
lingering O
cost O
of O
that O
could O
be O
high, O
" O
worries O
former O
national O
security O
adviser O
Zbigniew O
Brzezinski O
. O

But O
, O
he O
notes O
, O
" O
If O
everything O
crumbles O
totally O
, O
that O
wo O
n't O
be O
such O
a O
problem O
. O

" O
American O
officials O
staunchly O
disavow O
any O
interest O
in O
driving O
through O
Iraq O
toward O
Baghdad O
, O
either O
in O
pursuit O
of O
Saddam O
Hussein O
himself O
or O
to O
set O
up O
some O
American-controlled O
government O
inside O
Iraq O
. O

The O
Americans O
say O
their O
battle O
plans O
call O
for O
operating O
against O
forces O
inside O
Iraq O
as O
far O
north O
as O
the O
city O
of O
Basra O
, O
about O
30 O
miles O
north O
of O
Kuwait O
, O
but O
say O
there O
is O
n't O
any O
plan O
to O
drive O
beyond O
that O
. O

Indeed O
, O
French O
President O
Francois O
Mitterrand O
said O
yesterday B-TIMEX3
that O
some O
allied O
forces O
are O
crossing O
Iraqi O
territory O
as O
part O
of O
a O
" O
pincer O
" O
movement O
to O
trap O
the O
soldiers O
occupying O
Kuwait O
, O
but O
insisted O
, O
" O
The O
purpose O
is O
n't O
to O
invade O
Iraqi O
territory O
, O
that O
's O
not O
the O
aim O
, O
that O
is O
n't O
the O
mandate O
. O

" O
Nevertheless O
, O
American O
officials O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
weekend I-TIMEX3
became O
more O
open O
in O
declaring O
that O
by O
destroying O
Saddam O
Hussein O
's O
military O
machine O
they O
hope O
to O
destroy O
his O
regime O
- O
- O
a O
goal O
likely O
to O
be O
supported O
by O
most O
Americans O
. O

In O
a O
pre-attack O
message O
, O
Lt. O
Gen. O
Walter O
Boomer O
, O
the O
top O
Marine O
in O
the O
Persian O
Gulf O
, O
told O
U.S. O
Marines O
that O
their O
goal O
is O
to O
" O
restore O
{ O
Kuwait O
} O
to O
its O
citizens O
. O

" O
He O
went O
on O
to O
add O
that O
" O
in O
so O
doing O
you O
not O
only O
return O
a O
nation O
to O
its O
people O
, O
but O
you O
will O
destroy O
the O
war O
machine O
of O
a O
ruthless O
dictator O
. O

" O
Secretary O
of O
State O
James O
Baker O
said O
on O
ABC-TV O
's O
" O
This O
Week O
With O
David O
Brinkley O
" O
that O
the O
series O
of O
United O
Nations O
resolutions O
condemning O
Iraq O
's O
invasion O
of O
Kuwait O
" O
imply O
that O
the O
restoration O
of O
peace O
and O
stability O
in O
the O
Gulf O
would O
be O
a O
heck O
of O
a O
lot O
easier O
if O
he O
and O
that O
leadership O
were O
not O
in O
power O
in O
Iraq O
. O

" O
Of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
still O
far O
too O
early O
to O
assume O
that O
the O
military O
situation O
on O
the O
ground O
will O
stay O
as O
smooth O
for O
allied O
forces O
as O
it O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
so O
far O
. O

Iraq O
still O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
cause O
significant O
problems O
by O
using O
forces O
and O
weapons O
that O
do O
n't O
yet O
seem O
fully O
engaged O
. O

For O
one O
thing O
, O
Iraq O
still O
apparently O
has O
n't O
unleashed O
its O
stockpile O
of O
chemical O
weapons O
. O

Gen. O
Schwarzkopf O
said O
that O
some O
early O
reports O
that O
chemical O
weapons O
were O
used O
against O
allied O
troops O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
" O
bogus O
. O

" O
Iraq O
is O
believed O
to O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
deliver O
chemical O
weapons O
in O
artillery O
shells O
or O
, O
perhaps O
, O
atop O
Soviet-made O
Frog7 O
missiles O
. O

Perhaps O
more O
important O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
allied O
troops O
have O
n't O
yet O
fully O
engaged O
Iraq O
's O
vaunted O
Republican O
Guard O
, O
which O
has O
been O
sitting O
just O
north O
of O
the O
Iraq-Kuwait O
border O
and O
is O
considered O
the O
most O
potent O
element O
in O
the O
Iraqi O
defense O
. O

It O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O
how O
much O
damage O
the O
allied O
air O
campaign O
was O
able O
to O
inflict O
on O
the O
Guard O
, O
and O
whether O
President O
Hussein O
will O
commit O
his O
most O
valued O
troops O
to O
a O
fight-to-the-death O
finish O
. O

Certainly O
Saddam O
Hussein O
continues O
to O
implore O
his O
country O
to O
fight O
on O
. O

" O
Fight O
them, O
" O
he O
urged O
Iraqis O
in O
a O
radio O
address O
. O

" O
All O
Iraqis O
, O
fight O
them O
with O
all O
the O
power O
you O
have O
, O
and O
all O
struggle O
for O
everything O
. O

" O
American O
war O
planners O
have O
long O
assumed O
that O
the O
early O
stage O
of O
the O
ground O
attack O
, O
in O
which O
American O
forces O
would O
use O
their O
speed O
to O
sweep O
around O
Iraqi O
defenses O
and O
their O
strength O
to O
punch O
through O
the O
relatively O
weak O
Iraqi O
front O
line O
, O
would O
be O
the O
easiest O
part O
. O

Despite O
these O
early O
successes O
, O
the O
mere O
fact O
that O
a O
ground O
campaign O
has O
begun O
almost O
guarantees O
that O
the O
Bush O
administration O
will O
face O
fresh O
problems O
growing O
out O
of O
the O
military O
situation O
. O

There O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
additional O
American O
prisoners O
of O
war O
taken O
, O
and O
there O
are O
signs O
that O
President O
Hussein O
is O
taking O
Kuwaiti O
hostages O
. O

U.S. O
and O
Kuwaiti O
officials O
say O
there O
are O
reports O
that O
large O
numbers O
of O
civilians O
from O
Kuwait O
City O
are O
being O
rounded O
up O
and O
held O
by O
Iraqi O
troops O
, O
apparently O
either O
for O
use O
as O
human O
shields O
or O
for O
use O
later O
in O
bargaining O
once O
the O
war O
is O
over O
. O

President O
Bush O
's O
political O
argument O
for O
going O
to O
a O
ground O
war O
has O
been O
strengthened O
by O
the O
growing O
stream O
of O
reports O
of O
wanton O
Iraqi O
destruction O
inside O
Kuwait O
. O

U.S. O
officials O
say O
that O
hundreds O
of O
Kuwaiti O
oil O
wells O
now O
may O
have O
been O
set O
afire O
. O

And O
Robert O
Gates O
, O
Mr. O
Bush O
's O
deputy O
national O
security O
adviser O
, O
asserted O
in O
an O
interview O
on O
the O
Cable O
News O
Network O
that O
Iraqi O
troops O
have O
set O
fire O
to O
" O
large O
sections O
" O
of O
Kuwait O
City O
. O

Mr. O
Bush O
and O
his O
aides O
were O
leaning O
toward O
a O
military O
conclusion O
of O
the O
crisis O
even O
before O
the O
latest O
reports O
of O
Iraqi O
atrocities O
in O
Kuwait O
came O
to O
light O
. O

The O
president O
and O
his O
top O
aides O
tentatively O
decided O
on O
Feb. B-TIMEX3
11 I-TIMEX3
that O
a O
ground O
war O
would O
be O
necessary O
. O

The O
decision O
was O
made O
after O
Defense O
Secretary O
Dick O
Cheney O
and O
Gen. O
Colin O
Powell O
, O
chairman O
of O
the O
Joint O
Chiefs O
of O
Staff O
, O
returned O
from O
a O
visit O
with O
military O
commanders O
in O
Saudi O
Arabia O
, O
administration O
officials O
say O
. O

Then O
, O
a B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
or I-TIMEX3
so I-TIMEX3
ago I-TIMEX3
, O
Gen. O
Schwarzkopf O
secretly O
picked O
Saturday B-TIMEX3
night I-TIMEX3
as O
the O
optimal O
time O
to O
start O
the O
offensive O
. O

The O
date O
was O
unaffected O
by O
the O
last-ditch O
Soviet O
peace O
initiative O
. O

The O
real O
problem O
with O
the O
Soviet O
proposals O
, O
U.S. O
officials O
now O
say O
, O
was O
that O
they O
all O
would O
have O
required O
lifting O
economic O
sanctions O
against O
Iraq O
. O

The O
Bush O
administration O
considers O
the O
sanctions O
essential O
to O
keeping O
Saddam O
Hussein O
under O
control O
should O
he O
survive O
the O
war O
. O

Mr. O
Bush O
forestalled O
further O
diplomatic O
maneuvering O
by O
issuing O
an O
ultimatum O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
allies O
demanding O
that O
Iraq O
withdraw O
within O
a B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
, O
starting O
at O
noon B-TIMEX3
Saturday I-TIMEX3
. O

Administration O
aides O
said O
that O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
ultimatum O
was O
Gen. O
Powell O
's O
. O

He O
argued O
setting O
an O
explicit O
deadline O
for O
Saddam O
Hussein O
to O
break O
would O
, O
when O
it O
was O
broken O
, O
give O
the O
U.S. O
military O
a O
clear O
green O
light O
to O
proceed O
. O

In O
setting O
out O
his O
final O
challenge O
to O
Saddam O
Hussein O
, O
Mr. O
Bush O
continued O
the O
intensive O
personal O
diplomacy O
he O
began O
after O
the O
invasion O
last B-TIMEX3
August I-TIMEX3
. O

After O
cabling O
world O
leaders O
about O
his O
intention O
to O
give O
Saddam O
Hussein O
a O
final O
deadline O
to O
exit O
Kuwait O
, O
he O
offered O
him O
a B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
to O
withdraw O
fully O
, O
instead O
of O
the B-TIMEX3
four I-TIMEX3
days I-TIMEX3
he O
originally O
considered O
, O
because O
of O
objections O
from O
some O
European O
partners O
that O
four O
days O
seemed O
punitive O
and O
unrealistic O
. O

And O
when O
he O
and O
President O
Gorbachev O
spoke O
about O
the O
decision O
in O
a O
talk O
lasting O
nearly B-TIMEX3
an I-TIMEX3
hour I-TIMEX3
, O
the O
President O
took O
pains O
to O
listen O
to O
what O
his O
counterpart O
had O
to O
say O
, O
although O
he O
already O
had O
decided O
that O
the O
Soviet O
alternative O
to O
the O
allied O
deadline O
was O
unacceptable O
. O

Finally O
, O
when O
Iraq O
failed O
to O
respond O
to O
the O
U.S. O
ultimatum O
, O
Mr. O
Bush O
let O
the O
ground O
offensive O
begin O
as O
previously O
planned O
Saturday B-TIMEX3
night I-TIMEX3
. O

The O
attack O
was O
lightning O
quick O
, O
as O
allied O
forces O
punched O
through O
tall O
sand O
berms O
on O
the O
border O
and O
pushed O
forward O
into O
Iraq O
and O
Kuwait O
. O

U.S. O
Marines O
were O
said O
to O
have O
breached O
troublesome O
mine O
fields O
along O
the O
Iraqi O
lines O
but O
Pentagon O
officials O
said O
no O
amphibious O
assault O
on O
Kuwait O
's O
beaches O
had O
begun O
. O

Long O
columns O
of O
Iraqi O
prisoners O
of O
war O
could O
be O
seen O
trudging O
through O
the O
desert O
toward O
the O
allied O
rear O
. O

U.S. O
commanders O
said O
5,500 O
Iraqi O
prisoners O
were O
taken O
in O
the B-TIMEX3
first I-TIMEX3
hours I-TIMEX3
of O
the O
ground O
war O
, O
though O
some O
military O
officials O
later O
said O
the O
total O
may O
have O
climbed O
above O
8,000 O
. O

The O
U.S. O
hopes O
its O
troops O
will O
drive O
Iraqi O
forces O
out O
of O
Kuwait O
quickly O
, O
leaving O
much O
of O
Iraq O
's O
offensive O
military O
equipment O
destroyed O
or O
abandoned O
in O
Kuwait O
. O

It O
expects O
that O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
Iraqi O
soldiers O
will O
surrender O
to O
the O
U.S. O
and O
its O
allies O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
next I-TIMEX3
few I-TIMEX3
days I-TIMEX3
. O

If O
the O
allies O
succeed O
, O
Saddam O
Hussein O
will O
have O
plunged O
his O
country O
first O
into O
a O
fruitless O
eight-year B-TIMEX3
war O
against O
Iran O
and O
then O
into O
a O
humiliating O
war O
against O
the O
U.S. O
and O
the O
allies O
to O
defend O
his O
conquest O
of O
Kuwait O
, O
leaving O
much O
of O
his O
country O
's O
military O
establishment O
and O
modern O
infrastructure O
in O
ruins O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
U.S. O
hopes O
, O
economic O
sanctions O
and O
an O
international O
arms O
embargo O
will O
remain O
in O
effect O
until O
Iraq O
pays O
war O
reparations O
to O
Kuwait O
to O
cover O
war O
damages O
. O

That O
would O
undermine O
any O
chances O
of O
rebuilding O
either O
Iraq O
or O
its O
armed O
forces O
in O
short O
order O
as O
long O
as O
Saddam O
Hussein O
remains O
in O
power O
. O

The O
American O
hope O
is O
that O
someone O
from O
within O
Iraq O
, O
perhaps O
from O
the O
army O
's O
professional O
ranks O
, O
will O
step O
forward O
and O
push O
Saddam O
Hussein O
aside O
so O
that O
the O
country O
can O
begin O
recovering O
from O
the O
disaster O
. O

Outside O
analysts O
think O
Saddam O
Hussein O
's O
position O
is O
indeed O
precarious O
. O

" O
I O
think O
frankly O
Saddam O
is O
finished O
, O
no O
matter O
what O
happens, O
" O
says O
Christine O
Helms O
, O
a O
Middle O
East O
scholar O
who O
has O
written O
extensively O
about O
Iraq O
. O

" O
These O
guys O
simply O
do O
n't O
retire O
to O
condos O
over O
the O
Euphrates O
. O

" O
Despite O
the O
lack O
of O
any O
obvious O
successors O
, O
the O
Iraqi O
leader O
's O
internal O
power O
base O
appeared O
to O
be O
narrowing O
even O
before O
the O
war O
began O
. O

Some O
analysts O
say O
he O
appeared O
to O
be O
relying O
on O
a O
smaller O
and O
smaller O
circle O
of O
close O
advisers O
and O
relatives O
. O

If O
that O
's O
true O
, O
the O
narrowing O
of O
his O
support O
would O
make O
it O
easier O
for O
someone O
to O
push O
him O
aside O
from O
within O
. O

Yet O
, O
paradoxically O
, O
the O
perception O
that O
the O
U.S. O
wants O
to O
destroy O
Iraq O
may O
increase O
Saddam O
Hussein O
's O
support O
within O
the O
Iraqi O
military O
. O

And O
the O
U.S. O
now O
will O
face O
sharper O
questions O
in O
the O
Arab O
world O
since O
it O
did O
n't O
back O
the O
peace O
proposals O
worked O
out O
in O
Moscow O
. O

" O
We O
looked O
to O
the O
United O
States O
, O
we O
expected O
you O
to O
have O
the O
moral O
edge, O
" O
says O
Nasser O
Tahboub O
, O
a O
Jerusalem-born O
Jordanian O
who O
has O
an O
American O
wife O
and O
a O
doctorate O
in O
political O
science O
from O
Duke O
University O
. O

" O
Now O
we O
see O
that O
edge O
eroded O
. O

For O
me O
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
tragedy O
. O

For O
the O
first O
time O
in O
history O
, O
the O
U.S. O
has O
gone O
to O
war O
with O
an O
Arab O
and O
Muslim O
nation O
, O
and O
we O
know O
a O
peaceful O
solution O
was O
in O
reach O
. O
