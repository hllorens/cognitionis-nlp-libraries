The O
flu O
season O
is O
winding O
down O
, O
and O
it O
has O
killed O
105 O
children O
so O
far O
- O
about O
the O
average O
toll O
. O

The O
season O
started O
about O
a B-TIMEX3
month I-TIMEX3
earlier O
than O
usual O
, O
sparking O
concerns O
it O
might O
turn O
into O
the O
worst O
in O
a B-TIMEX3
decade I-TIMEX3
. O

It O
ended O
up O
being O
very O
hard O
on O
the O
elderly O
, O
but O
was O
moderately O
severe O
overall O
, O
according O
to O
the O
Centers O
for O
Disease O
Control O
and O
Prevention O
. O

Six O
of O
the O
pediatric O
deaths O
were O
reported O
in O
the B-TIMEX3
last I-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
, O
and O
it O
's O
possible O
there O
will O
be O
more O
, O
said O
the O
CDC O
's O
Dr. O
Michael O
Jhung O
said O
Friday B-TIMEX3
. O

Roughly O
100 O
children O
die O
in O
an O
average O
flu O
season O
. O

One O
exception O
was O
the O
swine O
flu O
pandemic O
of O
2009-2010 B-TIMEX3
, O
when O
348 O
children O
died O
. O

The O
CDC O
recommends O
that O
all O
children O
ages O
6 O
months O
and O
older O
be O
vaccinated O
against O
flu O
each B-TIMEX3
season I-TIMEX3
, O
though O
only O
about O
half O
get O
a O
flu O
shot O
or O
nasal O
spray O
. O

All O
but O
four O
of O
the O
children O
who O
died O
were O
old O
enough O
to O
be O
vaccinated O
, O
but O
90 O
percent O
of O
them O
did O
not O
get O
vaccinated O
, O
CDC O
officials O
said O
. O

This B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
's O
vaccine O
was O
considered O
effective O
in O
children O
, O
though O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
very O
well O
in O
older O
people O
. O

And O
the O
dominant O
flu O
strain O
early O
in O
the O
season O
was O
one O
that O
tends O
to O
cause O
more O
severe O
illness O
. O

The O
government O
only O
does O
a O
national O
flu O
death O
count O
for O
children O
. O

But O
it O
does O
track O
hospitalization O
rates O
for O
people O
65 O
and O
older O
, O
and O
those O
statistics O
have O
been O
grim O
. O

In O
that O
group O
, O
177 O
out O
of O
every O
100,000 O
were O
hospitalized O
with O
flu-related O
illness O
in O
the B-TIMEX3
past I-TIMEX3
several I-TIMEX3
months I-TIMEX3
. O

That O
's O
more O
than O
2 O
1/2 O
times O
higher O
than O
any O
other O
recent B-TIMEX3
season I-TIMEX3
. O

This O
flu O
season O
started O
in O
early B-TIMEX3
December I-TIMEX3
, O
a B-TIMEX3
month I-TIMEX3
earlier O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
peaked O
by O
the B-TIMEX3
end I-TIMEX3
of I-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
. O

Since O
then O
, O
flu O
reports O
have O
been O
dropping O
off O
throughout O
the O
country O
. O

" O
We O
appear O
to O
be O
getting O
close O
to O
the O
end O
of O
flu O
season, O

Mr O

of O

" O
We O
estimated O
we O
could O
do O
it O
in O
100 B-TIMEX3

and O
we O
got O
across O
on O
the B-TIMEX3
99th I-TIMEX3
day I-TIMEX3
. O

" O
There O
was O
a O
great O
feeling O
of O
euphoria O
from O
everyone O
. O

It O
had O
a O
multiplying O
effect O
. O

" O
We O
were O
pleased O
that O
England O

knew O
about O
it O

we O
thought O
that O

where O
it O

I O

funny O
lines O
by O
our O
presidents O
have O
had O
one O
thing O
in O
common O
: O
They O
were O
self-deprecating O
. O

Sure O
, O
some O
presidents O
have O
used O
jokes O
to O
take O
jabs O
at O
their O
opponents O
, O
but O
not O
to O
the O
extent O
of O
Obama O
. O

During O
his O
tenure B-TIMEX3
, O
he O
has O
increasingly O
unleashed O
biting O
comedic O
barbs O
against O
his O
critics O
and O
political O
adversaries O
. O

These O
jokes O
are O
intended O
to O
do O
more O
than O
simply O
entertain O
you O
. O

They O
have O
an O
agenda O
. O

Obama O
's O
humor O
is O
often O
delivered O
the O
way O
a O
comedian O
dealing O
with O
a O
heckler O
would O
do O
it O
. O

He O
tries O
to O
undermine O
his O
opponents O
with O
it O
and O
get O
the O
crowd O
- O
- O
in O
this O
case O
the O
public O
- O
- O
on O
his O
side O
. O

I O
can O
assure O
you O
that O
having O
a O
crowd O
laugh O
at O
your O
critic/heckler O
is O
not O
only O
effective O
in O
dominating O
them O
, O
it O
's O
also O
very O
satisfying O
. O

to O
his O

the B-TIMEX3
day I-TIMEX3
before O
the O

reported O
him O

The O
son O

is O
still O
pending O
, O
the O
district O
attorney O
said O
. O

Jonathan O
Roth O
's O
attorney O
, O
Joey O
Jackson O
, O
defended O
his O
client O
after O
his O

, O
saying O
, O
" O
There O
was O
abuse O
here O
, O
manipulation O
here O

" O
from O
the O

Raymond O
Roth O

, O
Brian O

, O
denied O
in O
August B-TIMEX3
that O
Roth O
had O
involved O
his O

in O
the O
scheme O
. O

" O
We O
had O
issues O

whether O
( O
Roth O
) O
had O
an O
agreement O
with O
his O

" O
Davis O
told O
CNN O
on O
Thursday B-TIMEX3

" O
He O
's O
admitted O
it O
now B-TIMEX3
. O

He O
's O
accepted O
responsibility O

" O
Davis O
added O
that O
his O
client O
has O
been O
under O
treatment O
for O
bipolar O
disorder O
in O
recent B-TIMEX3
weeks I-TIMEX3
. O

During O
plea O

, O
Raymond O
Roth O
asked O
the O
district O
attorney O

office O
not O
to O
give O
his O
son O
jail O
time O
, O
Davis O
said O
. O

On O
the O
advice O
of O
both O
their O
attorneys O
, O
father O
and O
son O
have O
not O
been O
in O

" O
He O
would O
like O
to O
straighten O
things O
out O
with O
( O
Jonathan O
) O
when O
the O
time O
comes, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Before O
the O
arrival O
of O
Keep O
, O
which O
Google O
launched O
this B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
, O
there O
was O
no O
default O
note-taking O
app O
for O
Android O
. O

It O
was O
a O
glaring O
hole O
, O
considering O
that O
Apple O
's O
iPhone O
has O
built-in O
Notes O
and O
Reminders O
apps O
that O
can O
be O
powered O
by O
Siri O
. O

Instead O
of O
settling O
for O
a O
bare O
bones O
app O
to O
fill O
the O
void O
, O
the O
search O
giant O
took O
things O
one O
step O
further O
. O

Keep O
is O
n't O
simply O
just O
a O
place O
to O
bank O
whatever O
random O
half-thoughts O
come O
to O
mind O
: O
Users O
can O
construct O
to-do O
lists O
, O
stash O
photos O
, O
and O
color O
code O
your O
notes O
- O
- O
all O
in O
one O
well-designed O
and O
easy-to-use O
interface O
. O

The O
second O
you O
log O
anything O
into O
your O
phone O
, O
it O
is O
also O
accessible O
from O
a O
PC O
Web O
browser O
via O
Google O
Drive O
. O

Alternatively O
, O
you O
can O
save O
things O
while O
working O
on O
your O
computer O
, O
and O
it O
will O
instantly O
appear O
on O
your O
phone O
, O
ready O
for O
use O
while O
on O
the O
go O
. O

The O
design O
may O
not O
be O
as O
progressive O
as O
the O
to-do O
app O
Clear O
, O
but O
Keep O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
in O
its O
simplicity O
and O
efficiency O
. O

Everything O
in O
Keep O
is O
presented O
like O
a O
Microsoft O
( O
MSFT O
, O
Fortune O
500 O
) O
Windows O
Phone-esque O
stream O
of O
tiles O
. O

Swiping O
left O
or O
right O
will O
archive O
those O
notes O
you O
no O
longer O
need O
( O
but O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
erase O
entirely O
) O
. O

At O
the O
top O
of O
the O
app O
is O
a O
text O
entry O
field O
that O
serves O
as O
your O
main O
point O
of O
entry O
for O
all O
new O
notes O
. O

And O
when O
viewing O
any O
specific O
note O
, O
tapping O
any O
part O
of O
that O
note O
( O
title O
, O
body O
, O
etc. O
) O
will O
allow O
you O
to O
edit O
it O
. O

The O
entire O
experience O
is O
frictionless O
. O

That O
said O
, O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
conquer O
the O
world O
quite O
yet O
. O

Organization O
options O
are O
limited O
- O
- O
color O
coding O
is O
your O
only O
choice O
, O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
re-order O
your O
notes O
. O

Sharing O
with O
others O
is O
mostly O
limited O
to O
email O
and O
Google+ O
, O
and O
the O
desktop O
features O
are O
pretty O
bare O
bones O
. O

But O
that O
's O
more O
a O
function O
of O
it O
being O
new O
, O
rather O
than O
poorly O
thought O
out O
. O

Like O
most O
things O
Google O
, O
expect O
the O
company O
to O
flesh O
out O
Keep O
over O
time O
and O
really O
turn O
it O
into O
our O
personal O
internet O
junk O
drawer O
. O

It O
's O
easy O
to O
foresee O
the O
day O
the O
when O
users O
will O
be O
able O
to O
send O
anything O
from O
their O
Web O
browser O
or O
Maps O
directly O
to O
Keep O
. O

The O
prospect O
of O
Keep O
incorporating O
features O
of O
services O
such O
as O
Pinterest O
or O
Pocket O
, O
or O
even O
making O
it O
easy O
to O
catalog O
streaming O
media O
, O
could O
turn O
it O
into O
something O
big O
. O

That O
should O
scare O
Evernote O
. O

Keep O
is O
not O
the O
reinvention O
of O
the O
wheel O
in O
any O
aspect O
- O
- O
there O
are O
a O
plethora O
of O
third-party O
apps O
already O
available O
for O
Android O
. O

But O
it O
is O
a O
well-exectuted O
refinement O
. O

In O
filling O
a O
minor O
, O
but O
important O
gap O
in O
its O
mobile O
ecosystem O
, O
Google O
gives O
the O
competition O
one O
less O
claim O
of O
superiority O
over O
Android O
. O

The O
FAA O
on O
Friday B-TIMEX3
announced O
it O
will O
close O
149 O
regional O
airport O
control O
towers O
because O
of O
forced O
spending O
cuts O
- O
- O
sparing O
40 O
others O
that O
the O
FAA O
had O
been O
expected O
to O
shutter O
. O

A O
four-week B-TIMEX3
, O
phased O
closure O
of O
the O
149 O
control O
towers O
will O
begin O
on O
April B-TIMEX3
7 I-TIMEX3
, O
the O
FAA O
said O
. O

The O
FAA O
had O
been O
expected O
to O
announce O
the O
closure O
of O
189 O
low O
- O
or O
moderate-volume O
towers O
staffed O
by O
contractors O
. O

Before O
Friday B-TIMEX3
's O
announcement O
, O
it O
said O
it O
would O
consider O
keeping O
a O
tower O
open O
if O
the O
airport O
convinces O
the O
agency O
it O
is O
in O
the O
" O
national O
interest O
" O
to O
do O
so O
. O

By O
congressional O
mandate O
, O
the O
FAA O
must O
cut O
nearly O
$600 O
million O
from O
its O
nearly O
$48 O
billion O
budget O
this B-TIMEX3
fiscal I-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
. O

Because O
the O
majority O
of O
its O
47,000 O
employees O
are O
air O
traffic O
controllers O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
cut O
its O
budget O
without O
affecting O
controllers O
, O
the O
agency O
says O
. O

President O
Barack O
Obama O
arrived O
in O
refugee-flooded O
Jordan O
on O
Friday B-TIMEX3
after O
scoring O
a O
diplomatic O
coup O
just O
before O
leaving O
Israel O
when O
Prime O
Minister O
Benjamin O
Netanyahu O
apologized O
to O
Turkey O
for O
a O
2010 B-TIMEX3
commando O
raid O
that O
killed O
nine O
activists O
on O
a O
Turkish O
vessel O
in O
a O
Gaza-bound O
flotilla O
. O

The O
apology O
, O
long O
sought O
by O
Turkish O
Prime O
Minister O
Recep O
Erdogan O
, O
eased O
strained O
feelings O
between O
Turkey O
and O
Israel O
, O
two O
vital O
U.S. O
allies O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O

It O
happened O
in O
a O
phone O
call O
to O
Erdogan O
during O
a O
final O
meeting O
between O
Obama O
and O
Netanyahu O
at O
Ben O
Gurion O
International O
Airport O
in O
Tel O
Aviv O
minutes B-TIMEX3
before O
Air O
Force O
One O
departed O
for O
Jordan O
to O
complete O
the O
president O
's O
Middle O
East O
swing O
. O

It O
is O
the O
first O
foreign O
trip O
of O
his O
second B-TIMEX3
term I-TIMEX3
. O

A O
statement O
from O
Netanyahu O
's O
office O
said O
the O
apology O
included O
an O
offer O
of O
compensation O
. O

However O
, O
there O
was O
confusion O
later O
when O
the O
Israeli O
government O
dropped O
a O
reference O
in O
its O
original O
statement O
to O
normalized O
relations O
between O
the O
countries O
with O
a O
return O
of O
ambassadors O
. O

There O
also O
was O
no O
word O
on O
whether O
the O
once-close O
nations O
would O
resume O
the O
joint O
military O
exercises O
that O
were O
suspended O
after O
the O
flotilla O
raid O
. O

Turkey O
had O
been O
prosecuting O
four O
Israeli O
soldiers O
in O
absentia O
and O
Israel O
initially O
said O
the O
two O
leaders O
agreed O
to O
the O
cancellation O
of O
legal O
steps O
against O
the O
troops O
. O

Later O
, O
however O
, O
its O
amended O
statement O
omitted O
that O
action O
as O
well O
. O

China O
's O
state O
leadership O
transition O
has O
taken O
place O
this B-TIMEX3
month I-TIMEX3
against O
an O
ominous O
backdrop O
. O

More O
than O
16,000 O
dead O
pigs O
have O
been O
found O
floating O
in O
rivers O
that O
provide O
drinking O
water O
to O
Shanghai O
. O

A O
haze O
akin O
to O
volcanic O
fumes O
cloaked O
the O
capital O
, O
causing O
convulsive O
coughing O
and O
obscuring O
the O
portrait O
of O
Mao O
Zedong O
on O
the O
gate O
to O
the O
Forbidden O
City O
. O

So O
severe O
are O
China O
's O
environmental O
woes O
, O
especially O
the O
noxious O
air O
, O
that O
top O
government O
officials O
have O
been O
forced O
to O
openly O
acknowledge O
them O
. O

Fu O
Ying O
, O
the O
spokeswoman O
for O
the O
National O
People O
's O
Congress O
, O
said O
she O
checked O
for O
smog O
every B-TIMEX3
morning I-TIMEX3
after O
opening O
her O
curtains O
and O
kept O
at O
home O
face O
masks O
for O
her O
daughter O
and O
herself O
. O

Li O
Keqiang O
, O
the O
new O
prime O
minister O
, O
said O
the O
air O
pollution O
had O
made O
him O
" O
quite O
upset O
" O
and O
vowed O
to O
" O
show O
even O
greater O
resolve O
and O
make O
more O
vigorous O
efforts O
" O
to O
clean O
it O
up O
. O

Last B-TIMEX3
month I-TIMEX3
, O
after O
deadly O
air O
pollution O
hit O
record O
levels O
in O
northern O
China O
, O
officials O
led O
byWen O
Jiabao O
, O
then O
the O
prime O
minister O
, O
put O
forward O
strict O
new O
fuel O
standards O
that O
the O
oil O
companies O
had O
blocked O
for O
years B-TIMEX3
. O

But O
there O
are O
doubts O
about O
whether O
the O
oil O
companies O
will O
comply O
, O
especially O
since O
oil O
officials O
resisted O
a O
similar O
government O
order O
for O
higher-grade O
fuel O
four B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
ago I-TIMEX3
. O

State-owned O
power O
companies O
have O
been O
similarly O
resistant O
. O

The O
companies O
regularly O
ignore O
government O
orders O
to O
upgrade O
coal-burning O
electricity O
plants O
, O
according O
to O
ministry O
data O
. O

And O
as O
with O
the O
oil O
companies O
, O
the O
power O
companies O
exert O
an O
outsize O
influence O
over O
environmental O
policy O
debates O
. O

In O
2011 B-TIMEX3
, O
during O
a O
round O
of O
discussions O
over O
stricter O
emissions O
standards O
, O
the O
China O
Electricity O
Council O
, O
which O
represents O
the O
companies O
, O
pushed O
back O
hard O
against O
the O
proposals O
, O
saying O
that O
the O
costs O
of O
upgrading O
the O
plants O
would O
be O
too O
high O
. O

On O
Feb. B-TIMEX3
28 I-TIMEX3
, O
Deutsche O
Bank O
released O
an O
analysts O
' O
note O
saying O
that O
China O

current O
economic O
policies O
would O
result O
in O
an O
enormous O
surge O
in O
coal O
consumption O
and O
automobile O
sales O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
next I-TIMEX3
decade I-TIMEX3
. O

" O
China O
's O
air O
pollution O
will O
become O
a O
lot O
worse O
from O
the O
already O
unbearable O
level, O
" O
the O
analysts O
said O
, O
calling O
for O
drastic O
policy O
changes O
and O
" O
a O
strong O
government O
will O
to O
overcome O
the O
opposition O
from O

well O

Cyprus O

one-half O

not O

From O
a O
financial O
standpoint O
, O
what O
is O
most O

is O
that O
the O
combined O
debt O
of O
the O

ratio O

to O
the O
ability O
of O
its O
citizens O
, O

to O
make O
good O
on O
them O
, O
the O
view O

that O

Eric O
Dor O
is O
a O
French O
economist O
who O
has O
studied O
the O
mechanics O
of O
how O
a O
country O
might O
remove O
itself O
from O
the O
monetary O
union O
. O

By O
his O
calculations O
, O
the O
euro O
zone O
- O
through O
its O
central O
banking O
system O
and O
its O
national O
banks O
- O
has O
just O
27 O
billion O
euros O
in O
outstanding O
credit O
exposure O
to O
Cyprus O
. O

That O
is O
a O
mere O
rounding O
error O
compared O
with O
the O
euro O
zone O
G.D.P. O
of O
9.4 O
trillion O
euros O
. O

Estimates O
of O
the O
potential O
cost O
if O
Greece O
had O
been O
forced O
into O
a O
disorderly O
euro O
exit O
have O
ranged O
from O
200 O
billion O
euros O
to O
800 O
billion O
euros O
, O
given O
the O
larger O
exposure O
that O
the O
European O
Central O
Bank O
and O
European O
banks O
had O
to O
the O
country O
. O

" O
This O
explains O
why O
Germany O
and O
others O
are O
putting O
so O
much O
pressure O
on O
Cyprus, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Dor O
, O
head O
of O
research O
at O
the O
Ieseg O
School O
of O
Management O
in O
Lille O
, O
France O
. O

" O
They O
are O
saying O
we O
can O
take O
the O
risk O
of O
pushing O
Cyprus O
out O
of O
the O
euro O
zone O
, O
and O
that O
Europe O
can O
take O
the O
losses O
without O
going O
broke O
. O

" O
Mr. O
Dor O
notes O
that O
the O
current O
euro O
zonewide O
system O
of O
insuring O
bank O
deposits O
up O
to O
100,000 O
euros O
was O
put O
in O
place O
after O
the O
financial O
panic O
that O
followed O
the O
Lehman O
collapse O
. O

Those O
deposits O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
insured O
by O
national O
governments O
. O

So O
when O
the O
president O
of O
Cyprus O
admitted O
this B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
that O
his O
country O
did O
not O
have O
the O
money O
to O
backstop O
the O
30 O
billion O
euros O
of O
guaranteed O
bank O
deposits O
- O
a O
figure O
greater O
than O
the O
Cypriot O
economy O
itself O
- O
a O
crucial O
bond O
of O
trust O
between O
a O
government O
and O
its O
citizens O
was O
snapped O
. O

" O
It O
is O
the O
first O
time O
ever O
that O
the O
leader O
of O
a O
euro O
zone O
country O
has O
admitted O
that O
he O
could O
not O
afford O
to O
pay O
the O
guarantee, O
" O
Mr. O
Dor O
said O
. O

A O
hasty O
expulsion O
from O
the O
euro O
zone O
would O
make O
the O
savings O
of O
the O
Cypriot O
people O
all O
the O
more O
evanescent O
, O
once O
they O
are O
converted O
back O

, O
the O

used O
before O
adopting O
the O

Former O

Nicolas O

was O
informed O
Thursday B-TIMEX3
that O
he O
would O
face O
a O
formal O
investigation O
into O
whether O
he O
abused O
the O
frailty O

the O

to O
get O

Mr. O

denied O

either O
personally O
or O
through O

Eric O

as O
alleged O
by O
her O
former O

Mr. O
Sarkozy O
's O
lawyer O
, O
Thierry O
Herzog O
, O
called O
the O
judge O

decision O
, O
which O
indicates O
that O
the O
judge O
believes O
that O
Mr. O

probably O
committed O
a O
crime O
, O
" O
incoherent O
" O
and O
" O
unjust O
. O

" O
The O
lawyer O
said O
he O
would O
appeal O

The O
ruling O
does O
not O
necessarily O
mean O
that O

An B-TIMEX3
hour I-TIMEX3
before O

, O
Senator O

slipped O
into O
an O

As O
Ms. O

sat O
down O
at O
the O

In O
the B-TIMEX3

24 I-TIMEX3

But O
with O
20 O
female O
senators O
now B-TIMEX3
in O
office O
, O
an O
all-time O
high O
, O
women O
have O
morphed O
from O
the O
curiosity O
they O
were O
for O
much O
of O
the O
20th B-TIMEX3
century I-TIMEX3
into O
an O
important O
new O
force O
on O
key O
committees O

. O

A O
record O
nine O
women O
now B-TIMEX3
lead O
committees O

including O
some O
of O
the O
most O
powerful O
ones O

For O
the O
first O

is O

woman O
- O
Senator O
Barbara O
A. O
Mikulski O
, O
a O
Maryland O
Democrat O

in O
charge O
of O
the O
Senate O
Appropriations O
Committee O
, O
which O
dispenses O
billions O
of O
dollars O
annually B-TIMEX3
throughout O
the O
government O
and O
has O
long O
been O
particularly O
dominated O
by O
men O

Senator O
Patty O

Washington O
Democrat O
, O
is O
the O
first O

with O

One O
of O
the O
biggest O
bills O
to O
pass O

Senate O
last B-TIMEX3

was O
farm O

" O
We O
are O

" O
said O
Senator O
Amy O

, O
Democrat O
of O
Minnesota O
. O

" O
But O
more O
importantly O
, O
we O
are O
growing O
in O
our O
power O
. O

When O
I O
first O
started O
just O
six B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
ago I-TIMEX3
, O
it O
was O
unusual O
to O
have O
a O
woman O
managing O
a O
bill O
. O

" O
Just O
as O
important O
, O
even O
male O
senators O
say O
, O
is O
the O
potential O
the O
women O
hold O
for O
changing O
the O
tenor O
of O
the O
Senate O
and O
pushing O
for O
compromise O
in O
the O
highly O
partisan O
atmosphere O
on O
Capitol O
Hill O
. O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
generalize O
, O
because O
this O
is O
n't O
true O
of O
all O
of O
them O
, O
but O
they O
tend O
to O
be O
interested O
in O
finding O
common O
ground, O
" O
said O
Senator O
Rob O
Portman O
, O
Republican O
of O
Ohio O

" O
So O
I O
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
have O
, O
and O
is O
having O
, O
a O
positive O
impact O
on O
the O
Senate O

" O
While O
partisan O
division O
is O
the O
central O
characteristic O
of O
the O
modern O
Congress O
, O
women O
have O
begun O
to O
crack O
away O
at O
the O
gridlock O
by O
forming O
coalitions O
that O
have O
surprised O
leaders O
of O
both O
parties O
. O

Senator O
Kirsten O
E. O
Gillibrand O
, O
Democrat O
of O
New O

, O
and O

This B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
, O
all O
four O
of O
the O
female O
Senate O
Republicans O
split O
with O
their O
party O
and O
voted O
with O
Senate O

to O
reauthorize O
the O
Violence O

Act O
, O
which O
had O
lapsed O
during O
the O
last O

Our O
digital B-TIMEX3
age O
is O
all O
about O
bits O
, O
those O
precise O
ones O
and O
zeros O
that O
are O
the O
stuff O
of O
modern O
computer O
code O
. O

But O
a O
powerful O
new O
type O
of O
computer O
that O
is O
about O
to O
be O
commercially O
deployed O
by O
a O
major O
American O
military O
contractor O
is O
taking O
computing O
into O
the O
strange O
, O
subatomic O
realm O
of O
quantum O
mechanics O
. O

In O
that O
infinitesimal O
neighborhood O
, O
common O
sense O
logic O
no O
longer O
seems O
to O
apply O
. O

A O
one O
can O
be O
a O
one O

or O
it O
can O
be O
a O
one O
and O
a O
zero O
and O
everything O
in O
between O
all O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

It O
sounds O
preposterous O
, O
particularly O
to O
those O
familiar O
with O
the O
yes/no O
world O
of O
conventional O
computing O
. O

But O
academic O
researchers O
and O
scientists O
at O
companies O
like O
Microsoft O
, O
I.B.M. O
and O
Hewlett-Packard O
have O
been O
working O
to O
develop O
quantum O
computers O
. O

Now B-TIMEX3
, O
Lockheed O
Martin O
which O
bought O
an O
early O
version O
of O
such O
a O
computer O
from O
the O
Canadian O
company O
D-Wave O
Systems O
two B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3

is O
confident O
enough O
in O
the O
technology O
to O
upgrade O
it O
to O
commercial O
scale O
, O
becoming O
the O
first O
company O
to O
use O
quantum O
computing O
as O
part O
of O
its O
business O
. O

Skeptics O
say O
that O
D-Wave O
has O
yet O
to O
prove O
to O
outside O
scientists O
that O
it O
has O
solved O
the O
myriad O
challenges O
involved O
in O
quantum O
computation O
. O

But O
if O
it O
performs O
as O
Lockheed O
and O
D-Wave O
expect O
, O
the O
design O
could O
be O
used O
to O
supercharge O
even O
the O
most O
powerful O
systems O
, O
solving O
some O
science O
and O

problems O
millions O

Ray O

first O
three-month B-TIMEX3
class O
in O
Seattle O
, O
out O
of O
nearly O
500 O
applicants O
. O

Microsoft O
said O
it O
has O
identified O
three O
companies O
for O
the O
China O
program O
to O
run O
through O
June B-TIMEX3
. O

The O
company O
gives O
each O
participating O
startup O
in O
the O
Seattle O
program O
$20,000 O
to O
create O
software O
that O
can O
be O
used O
with O
Kinect O
for O
Windows O
, O
but O
it O
is O
is O
n't O
asking O
for O
any O
ownership O
stakes O
or O
intellectual O
property O
rights O
. O

Microsoft O
also O
does O
n't O
have O
any O
veto O
power O
over O
the O
ideas O
. O

What O
Microsoft O
gets O
are O
developers O
around O
the O
world O
working O
on O
ideas O
that O
could O
potentially O
open O
up O
Kinect O
for O
Windows O
' O
technology O
to O
new O
markets O
- O
and O
convince O
consumers O
and O
businesses O
to O
buy O
the O
company O
's O
hardware O
and O
make O
use O
of O
the O
potential O
apps O
. O

The O
Windows-ready O
Kinect O
sensor O
, O
which O
would O
be O
necessary O
for O
any O
business O
that O
wants O
to O
use O
these O
potential O
new O
technologies O
, O
is O
currently B-TIMEX3
selling O
for O
$250 O
through O
Microsoft O
, O
more O
than O
twice O
what O
Microsoft O
charges O
for O
the O
gaming-only O
Xbox O
version O
. O

In O
competitions O
against O
the O
clock O
, O
some O
athletes O
display O
an O
ability O
to O
seize O
control O
. O

Think O
of O
the O
Clark-Kent-to-Superman O
routines O
that O
John O
Elway O
and O
Michael O
Jordan O
often O
pulled O
in O
the O
final O
seconds O
. O

But O
Iram O
Leon O
stands O
on O
the O
sidelines O
of O
his O
own O
race O
against O
time O
. O

Lodged O
in O
his O
brain O
is O
an O
untreatable O
and O
inoperable O
cancerous O
tumor O
that O
statistics O
suggest O
will O
kill O
him O
before O
he O
is O
40 O
, O
eight B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
from O
now B-TIMEX3
. O

Medical O
science O
is O
advancing O
at O
a O
rate O
that O
does O
n't O
preclude O
the O
development O
of O
a O
treatment O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
clear O
if O
it O
will O
come O
in O
time O
. O

" O
No O
one O
knows O
what O
technology O
will O
be O
available O
in O
five B-TIMEX3
years, O
" O
said O
Allan O
Friedman O
, O
Duke O
University O
Hospital O
neurosurgeon O
in O
chief O
, O
who O
in O
2011 B-TIMEX3
removed O
as O
much O
of O
Leon O
's O
brain O
tumor O
as O
possible O
. O

The O
torment O
of O
enduring O
that O
wait O
can O
paste O
a O
cancer O
patient O
to O
the O
couch O
, O
a O
surrender O
heavily O
associated O
with O
deadlier O
outcomes O
. O

Some O
seek O
escape O
in O
their O
careers O
, O
but O
that O
is O
no O
longer O
an O
option O
for O
Leon O
, O
who O
early B-TIMEX3
this I-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
was O
forced O
to O
step O
down O
as O
a O
juvenile O
probation O
officer O
in O
Travis O
County O
, O
Texas O
, O
a O
position O
he O
had O
held O
for O
almost B-TIMEX3
seven I-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
. O

His O
thinking O
is O
no O
longer O
clear O
, O
said O
Leon O
, O
adding O
, O
" O
I O
was O
making O
too O
many O
mistakes O
on O
the O
stand O
. O

" O
But O
Leon O
can O
still O
run O
. O

Two B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
after O
his O
brain-cancer O
diagnosis O
, O
he O
recently O
ran O
a O
sub-five-minute O
mile O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
high O
school O
. O

What O
has O
startled O
the O
medical O
community O
even O
more O
is O
what O
Leon O
did O
this B-TIMEX3
month I-TIMEX3
in O
Beaumont O
, O
Texas O
. O

He O
won O
the O
Gusher O
Marathon O
, O
finishing O
in O
3:07:35 B-TIMEX3
. O

That O
was O
one O
second O
slower O
than O
his O
personal O
record O
in O
the O
26.2-mile O
event O
, O
set O
days B-TIMEX3
before O
he O
underwent O
brain O
surgery O
in O
early B-TIMEX3
2011 I-TIMEX3
. O

Israeli O
Prime O
Minister O
Benjamin O
Netanyahu O
apologized O
on O
Friday B-TIMEX3
to O
Turkish O
Prime O
Minister O
Recep O
Tayyip O
Erdogan O
for O
a O
raid O
on O
a O
Turkish O
flotilla O
ship O
, O
a O
move O
that O
will O
help O
restore O
strained O
ties O
between O
the O
countries O
. O

The O
call O
, O
which O
happened O
as O
President O
Barack O
Obama O
wrapped O
up O
his O
first O
presidential O
visit O
to O
Israel O
, O
was O
an O
unexpected O
outcome O
from O
a O
Mideast O
trip O
that O
seemed O
to O
yield O
few O
concrete O
steps O
. O

Mr. O
Netanyahu O
's O
office O
confirmed O
that O
the O
Israeli O
leader O
, O
in O
a O
conversation O
with O
Mr. O
Erdogan O
, O
" O
agreed O
to O
restore O
normalization O
between O
Israel O
and O
Turkey O
, O
including O
the O
dispatch O
of O
ambassadors O
and O
the O
cancellation O
of O
legal O
steps O
against O
[ O
Israeli O
Defense O
Forces O
] O
soldiers O
. O

" O
Mr. O
Erdogan O
accepted O
the O
Israeli O
apology O
, O
the O
prime O
minister O
's O
office O
said O
. O

Mr. O
Erdogan O
has O
long O
sought O
an O
apology O
for O
the O
raid O
in O
May B-TIMEX3
2010 I-TIMEX3
on O
the O
Mavi O
Marmara O
, O
which O
was O
part O
of O
a O
flotilla O
that O
sought O
to O
break O
Israel O
's O
blockade O
of O
Gaza O
. O

An O
Israeli O
raid O
on O
the O
ship O
left O
nine O
passengers O
dead O
, O
all O
of O
them O
Turkish O
or O
of O
Turkish O
descent O
. O

" O
In O
light O
of O
the O
Israeli O
investigation O
into O
the O
incident O
, O
which O
pointed O
out O
several O
operational O
errors O
, O
Prime O
Minister O
Netanyahu O
apologized O
to O
the O
Turkish O
people O
for O
any O
errors O
that O
could O
have O
led O
to O
loss O
of O
life O
and O
agreed O
to O
complete O
the O
agreement O
on O
compensation, O
" O
the O
statement O
said O
. O

Mr. O
Netanyahu O
told O
Mr. O
Erdogan O
that O
what O
happened O
on O
board O
the O
Mavi O
Marmara O
was O
" O
unintentional O
and O
Israel O
expresses O
regret O
over O
injuries O
and O
loss O
of O
life, O
" O
according O
to O
the O
statement O
. O

Mr. O
Obama O
said O
later O
at O
a O
news O
conference O
in O
Amman O
that O
he O
had O
spoken O
to O
both O
leaders O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
past I-TIMEX3
two I-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
about O
how O
it O
was O
in O
the O
interests O
of O
both O
countries O
to O
restore O
normal O
relations O
. O

He O
said O
he O
discussed O
the O
issue O
with O
Mr. O
Netanyahu O
during O
his O
visit O
to O
Israel O
this B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
, O
and O
that O
they O
agreed O
the O
timing O
was O
good O
for O
a O
discussion O
with O
the O
Turkish O
leader O
. O

The O
incident O
was O
a O
subject O
of O
talks O
between O
Mr. O
Netanyahu O
and O
President O
Barack O
Obama O
during O
the O
president O
's O
trip O
to O
Israel O
this B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
, O
officials O
said O
. O

Health O
insurers O
are O
privately O
warning O
brokers O
that O
premiums O
for O
many O
individuals O
and O
small O
businesses O
could O
increase O
sharply O
next B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
because O
of O
the O
health-care O
overhaul O
law O
, O
with O
the O
nation O
's O
biggest O
firm O
projecting O
that O
rates O
could O
more O
than O
double O
for O
some O
consumers O
buying O
their O
own O
plans O
. O

The O
projections O
, O
made O
in O
sessions O
with O
brokers O
and O
agents O
, O
provide O
some O
of O
the O
most O
concrete O
evidence O
yet O
of O
how O
much O
insurance O
companies O
might O
increase O
prices O
when O
major O
provisions O
of O
the O
law O
kick O
in O
next B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
- O
a O
subject O
of O
rigorous O
debate O
. O

The O
projected O
increases O
are O
at O
odds O
with O
what O
the O
Obama O
Administration O
says O
consumers O
should O
be O
expecting O
overall O
in O
terms O
of O
cost O
. O

The O
Department O
of O
Health O
and O
Human O
Services O
says O
that O
the O
law O
will O
" O
make O
health-care O
coverage O
more O
affordable O
and O
accessible, O
" O
pointing O
to O
a O
2009 B-TIMEX3
analysis O
by O
the O
Congressional O
Budget O
Office O
that O
says O
average O
individual O
premiums O
, O
on O
an O
apples-to-apples O
basis O
, O
would O
be O
lower O
. O

The O
gulf O
between O
the O
pricing O
talk O
from O
some O
insurers O
and O
the O
government O
projections O
suggests O
how O
complicated O
the O
law O
's O
effects O
will O
be O
. O

Carriers O
will O
be O
filing O
proposed O
prices O
with O
regulators O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
next I-TIMEX3
few I-TIMEX3
months I-TIMEX3
. O

Part O
of O
the O
murkiness O
stems O
from O
the O
role O
of O
government O
subsidies O
. O

Federal O
subsidies O
under O
the O
health O
law O
will O
help O
lower-income O
consumers O
defray O
costs O
, O
but O
they O
are O
generally O
not O
included O
in O
insurers O
' O
premium O
projections O
. O

Many O
consumers O
will O
be O
getting O
more O
generous O
plans O
because O
of O
new O
requirements O
in O
the O
law O
. O

The O
effects O
of O
the O
law O
will O
vary O
widely O
, O
and O
insurers O
and O
other O
analysts O
agree O
that O
some O
consumers O
and O
small O
businesses O
will O
likely O
see O
premiums O
go O
down O
. O

Starting O
next B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
, O
the O
law O
will O
block O
insurers O
from O
refusing O
to O
sell O
coverage O
or O
setting O
premiums O
based O
on O
people O
's O
health O
histories O
, O
and O
will O
reduce O
their O
ability O
to O
set O
rates O
based O
on O
age O
. O

That O
can O
raise O
coverage O
prices O
for O
younger O
, O
healthier O
consumers O
, O
while O
reining O
them O
in O
for O
older O
, O
sicker O
ones O
. O

The O
rules O
can O
also O
affect O
small O
businesses O
, O
which O
sometimes O
pay O
premiums O
tied O
to O
employees O
' O
health O
status O
and O
claims O
