HMM tagger based on https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm 
Based on Alexander Rush reference solution

I tuned it a bit and moved a baseline version of it to Java
See github cognitionis-nlp-libraries/nlp-taggers/src/main/java/com/cognitionis/nlp_taggers/Baseline_MostFrequentTag.java
I did some trials to train and test with features based on configurations (e.g., num_class, time_class)
